Introduction

In the course of our routine investigation, we discovered a DLL file, identified as hrserv.dll,
which is a previously unknown web shell exhibiting sophisticated features such as custom
encoding methods for client communication and in-memory execution. Our analysis of the
sample led to the discovery of related variants compiled in 2021, indicating a potential
correlation between these separate occurrences of malicious activity.

Initial infection

According to our telemetry data, the PAExec.exe process initiates the creation of a
scheduled task on the system named MicrosoftsUpdate (sic), which in turn is designed to
execute a .BAT file.

2

"schtasks" /create /sc DAILY /tn MicrosoftsUpdate /tr "$system32\cmd.exe /c

$public\JKNLA.bat $public\hrserv.dll" /ru system /f

The .BAT file accepts the path of a DLL file as an argument. In this instance, the script is
provided with the file $public\hrserv.dll, which is then copied to the System32 directory. After
this operation, the script configures a service via the system registry and the sc utility. It then
activates the newly created service.

File type PE32+ executable (DLL) (console) x86-64, for MS Windows

Compiler Microsoft Visual C/C++(2015 v.14.0)

The sequence of operations starts with the registration of a service handler. HrServ then
initiates an HTTP server utilizing the HTTP server API for its functionality. It calls the
HttpAddUrlToGroup function to register the following URL so that matching requests are
routed to the request queue.

1 http://+:80/FC4B97EB-2965-4A3B-8BAD-B8172DE25520/

Client-server communication uses custom encoding techniques that include Base64
encoding and FNV1A64 hashing algorithms.

Based on the type and information within an HTTP request, specific functions are activated.
These functions are distinguished by the GET parameter named cp. In addition, the DLL file
utilizes the value of the NID cookie for various purposes. The use of the GET parameter
pattern and the cookie value is consistent with practices employed by Google. We suspect
that this intentional similarity in naming conventions is intended to disguise these requests in
network traffic, making it more challenging to detect such malicious activity.

An example of such a request would be:

1 &cp=1&client=desktop-gws-wiz-on-focus-serp&xssi=t&hl=en-TW&authuser=0&pq=

Call VirtualAlloc and copy a custom decoded NID cookie value, then
create a new thread.

Create a file using the custom decoded NID cookie value and write the
custom decoded POST data to that file.

Read a file using the custom decoded NID cookie value and return it as
a response by appending it to the end of the “data:image/png;base64”
string;
If an error occurs while reading the file, HrServ responds with the
string:
data:image/png;base64,c3Dlc+DheRzlKBV2Yh92KS//;

Code execution

If the cp value in the request is 6, this indicates a code execution process.

Initially, it extracts the value of the NID cookie and applies its custom decoding
technique
It writes this decoded value to the specified registry path, denoted as
“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\IdentityStore\RemoteFile”
The custom-decoded POST data is then copied to the memory, after which a new
thread is created and the process enters a sleep state.

In a particular observed scenario, the cp value is unknown. A multifunctional implant is
activated in the system memory. The implant creates a file in the directory “%temp%”,
retrieves information from the registry, performs some actions based on this information, and
records the output of these actions in the created file. As a result, the registry and the
temporary file are used as a communication channel between the implant and HrServ.

Available commands of the memory implant

Based on our telemetry data, after successfully establishing a foothold and placing the
memory implant in the system memory, the next actions are to erase the previously existing
traces by deleting the scheduled “MicrosoftsUpdate” job and both the initial DLL and batch
files:

schtasks /delete /tn MicrosoftsUpdate /f

cmd /c "del /f/s/q $public\hrserv.dll & del /f/s/q $public\JKNLA.bat"

Older variants

We have also discovered earlier, differently named variants of HrServ. These DLL files date
back to early 2021. They also use the custom encoding algorithm and behave the same way
after a file read error. However, there are subtle differences.

4/6

The web shell URL of these older variants differs from the current one:

1 https://+:443/owa/MSExchangeService.svc

These samples exhibit a distinct behavior by creating a process and retrieving its
output through a pipe, as opposed to allocating a memory section and creating a
thread from it.

Victims

The only known victim according to our telemetry is a government entity in Afghanistan.

Attribution

The TTPs analyzed in this investigation are not associated with any known threat actors we
are tracking, but there are a few things that we observed:

the GET parameters used in the hrserv.dll file, which is used to mimic Google services,
include “hl”. This specifies the host language of the user interface. Although this
parameter has no functionality within the attack vector, the assigned value “en-TW”
specifies that the Google search interface should be displayed in English, but the
search results should be displayed in Traditional Chinese:

1 &cp=1&client=desktop-gws-wiz-on-focus-serp&xssi=t&hl=en-TW&authuser=0&pq=

the samples include help strings for specific conditions, in English. We saw multiple
typos that suggest the actor behind the samples is not a native English speaker.

Conclusion

The analyzed sample represents a capable web shell. Based on the compile timestamps, its
origins date back to at least 2021. This sophisticated malware variant exhibits the ability to
initiate in-memory executions. In the observed scenario, communication is established
through registry manipulations and temporary files.

5/6

 
Notably, the web shell and memory implant use different strings for specific conditions. In
addition, the memory implant features a meticulously crafted help message. Considering
these factors, the malware’s characteristics are more consistent with financially motivated
malicious activity. However, its operational methodology exhibits similarities with APT
behavior. Despite the malware’s prolonged activity over several years, multiple instances
involving these samples have not been documented. Our efforts are ongoing as we continue
to monitor related activity, with the goal of unraveling the mystery in future investigations.
