iv  ABOUT THIS REPORT 

 
 
 
About this report 

The Microsoft Security Intelligence Report (SIR) focuses on software 
vulnerabilities, software vulnerability exploits, malware, and unwanted software. 
Past reports and related resources are available for download at 
www.microsoft.com/sir. We hope that readers find the data, insights, and 
guidance provided in this report useful in helping them protect their 
organizations, software, and users. 

Reporting period 

This volume of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report focuses on the first and 
second quarters of 2015, with trend data for the last several quarters presented 
on a quarterly basis. Because vulnerability disclosures can be highly inconsistent 
from quarter to quarter and often occur disproportionately at certain times of 
the year, statistics about vulnerability disclosures are presented on a half-yearly 
basis. 

Throughout the report, half-yearly and quarterly time periods are referenced 
using the nHyy or nQyy formats, in which yy indicates the calendar year and n 
indicates the half or quarter. For example, 1H15 represents the first half of 2015 
(January 1 through June 30), and 4Q14 represents the fourth quarter of 2014 
(October 1 through December 31). To avoid confusion, please note the reporting 
period or periods being referenced when considering the statistics in this report. 

Conventions 

This report uses the Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC) naming 
standard for families and variants of malware. For information about this 
standard, see “Appendix A: Threat naming conventions” on page 123. In this 
report, any threat or group of threats that share a common unique base name is 
considered a family for the sake of presentation. This consideration includes 
threats that may not otherwise be considered families according to common 
industry practices, such as generic detections. For the purposes of this report, a 
threat is defined as a malware or unwanted software family or variant that is 
detected by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine.

Foreword 

Welcome to Volume 19 of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report (SIR). I’ve 
contributed to the SIR for almost ten years now. If I had to describe how the 
threat landscape has changed during that time using only one word, I’d say it’s 
“cumulative.”  

Ten years ago we reported on a range of threats that included trojans, worms, 
trojan downloaders & droppers, exploits, bots (backdoor trojans), among 
others. These types of threats were primarily motivated by a desire to disrupt 
networks, as worms did years earlier, or to seek profit.  

Fast forward ten years and we still see the same categories of threats and even 
some of the same threat families employed. During this time, attackers have had 
to evolve their tactics to get malware onto computers that have also been 
evolving with continuously elevating security levels. As vulnerabilities in 
operating systems have become harder to find and exploit, attackers have relied 
increasingly on social engineering to compromise computer systems. 

In addition to these types of attacks, we have seen more threat actors with 
different motivations emerge over the years, including hacktivists and 
practitioners of military and economic espionage. Rogue security software or 
fake antivirus software that was used to trick people into installing malware and 
disclosing credit card information to attackers has been replaced by 
ransomware that seeks to extort victims by encrypting their data. Commercial 
exploit kits now dominate the list of top exploits we see trying to compromise 
unpatched computers, which means the exploits that computers are exposed to 
on the Internet are professionally managed and constantly optimized at an 
increasingly quick rate. Targeted attacks have become common as opposed to 
the exception.  

Attackers continue to try to use the tactics that they did years ago, and have 
added to their repertoire of dirty tricks. This is why I use the word “cumulative” to 
describe how things have changed. If I could use a second word to describe how 
they have changed I would use “accelerated.” The focus and pace that some 
attackers have been demonstrating recently have certainly increased over time. 

vi  FOREWORD 

 
 
Notice I didn’t use the word “advanced.” Although attackers have accumulated 
more tricks and tactics and seem to be using them in a more focused, fast-
paced way, they still focus on a relatively small number of ways to compromise 
computers, including: 

  Unpatched vulnerabilities 

  Misconfigured computers 

  Weak passwords 

  Social engineering 

The great news if you are a CISO or security professional is that you’ve never 
had so much information and so many security capabilities and tools as you do 
today to defend your organization’s data. 

Please enjoy the report.

STRONTIUM: A profile of a 
persistent and motivated 
adversary 

A research team at the Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC) 
proactively monitors the threat landscape for emerging threats. Part of this job 
involves keeping tabs on targeted attack groups, which are often the first ones 
to introduce new exploits and techniques that are later used widely by other 
attackers. One such group, which Microsoft has code-named STRONTIUM, is of 
particular interest because of its aggressive, persistent tactics and techniques, 
and its repeated use of new zero-day exploits to attack its targets. Microsoft is 
sharing some of the information it has gathered on this prominent attack group 
in the hope that it will raise awareness of the group’s activities and help 
organizations take immediate advantage of available mitigations that can 
significantly reduce the risks that they face from this and similar groups. 

Adversary profile 

STRONTIUM has been active since at least 2007. Whereas most modern 
untargeted malware is ultimately profit-oriented, STRONTIUM mainly seeks 
sensitive information. Its primary institutional targets have included government 
bodies, diplomatic institutions, and military forces and installations in NATO 
member states and certain Eastern European countries. Additional targets have 
included journalists, political advisors, and organizations associated with political 
activism in central Asia. STRONTIUM is Microsoft’s code name for this group, 
following its internal practice of assigning chemical element names to activity 
groups; other researchers have used code names such as APT28,1 Sednit,2 
Sofacy,3 and Fancy Bear as labels for a group or groups that have displayed

activity similar to the activity observed from STRONTIUM. The group’s persistent 
use of spear phishing tactics and access to previously undiscovered zero-day 
exploits have made it a highly resilient threat. 

How STRONTIUM attacks a target 

STRONTIUM primarily uses two kinds of attack. It uses spear phishing—phishing 
attempts targeted at specific individuals—to perform reconnaissance and steal

login credentials to gather information about potential high-
value targets associated with the institution under attack. 
Following the reconnaissance phase, it uses a variety of 
methods to infect the computers of high-value targets with 
malware, often by exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities 
in browser add-ons and other software.  

Reconnaissance and target identification 

STRONTIUM typically begins its attack on an institution by 
identifying and profiling potential victims with connections to 
the institution. Microsoft has seen indications that STRONTIUM 
relies on open-source intelligence (OSINT), such as email lists 
and information harvested from public forums or social 
networking sites, to identify targets for spear phishing. Microsoft 
also believes that STRONTIUM relies on past successful phishing 
attacks to augment its dataset, by making use of any email 

communications it can identify between prior targets and the current target. 

STRONTIUM casts a wide net with its reconnaissance activities, seeking login 
credentials for email and other systems from a large number of people, which it 
then weeds through to assess its value. Microsoft believes STRONTIUM used its 
spear phishing attacks to target several thousand individuals during the first half 
of 2015. Although STRONTIUM isn’t choosy with its targets, it is persistent. When 
STRONTIUM identifies an individual to target, the group will repeatedly conduct 
spear phishing attacks against it over a long duration, possibly a year or more, 
until one of the attempts succeeds. 

STRONTIUM’s spear phishing modus operandi focuses on making the recipient 
concerned about unauthorized use of an account. A recent attack campaign 
involved sending messages with the subject line “Privacy alert” purporting to 
originate from a well-known email service, informing the user that their account

has been accessed from an unrecognized device in a different country. Because 
the targeted individuals are often professionals who have access to sensitive 
information, this can be an effective way to entice users to click a “change 
password” link that actually leads to a webpage under the attacker’s control.  

Figure 1. An example of a credential-stealing spear phishing message sent by STRONTIUM 

Typically, the link will lead to a domain name that is similar to a legitimate 
domain name used by the service in an effort to fool the user into thinking the 
message is legitimate. Figure 2 lists some examples.

If the attack is successful, STRONTIUM uses the captured credentials to access 
the victim’s email account to identify additional targets and for additional 
analysis and attacks. Even if the recipient doesn’t enter their login credentials 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015   5 

 
 
 
 
into the malicious webpage, the act of clicking the link can provide STRONTIUM 
with valuable information. In addition to providing STRONTIUM with the 
recipient’s IP address, clicking the link transmits a user-agent string to the web 
server that typically includes details about the recipient’s browser and operating 
system versions, and sometimes includes information about the browser add-
ons the recipient is using. This can provide STRONTIUM with insight into what 
software is deployed in the organization, and possibly help it plan future drive-
by download activities.

Attacking the target 

The ultimate goal of the reconnaissance phase is to compile a list of high-value 
individuals who have information or access that STRONTIUM wants. With this list 
at hand, the group moves to the next phase of operations: installing malware on

the high-value targets’ computers, and thereby gaining access to the 
institution’s network. 

STRONTIUM primarily uses email to deliver malware to targeted individuals, 
although some researchers have reported delivery through social networking 
channels as well. Typical messages, such as the one shown in Figure 4, are tied 
to current events: an upcoming conference, for example, or a real world news 
event in which the recipient might be interested. STRONTIUM’s email senders 
are usually associated with well-known email providers, and use plausible-
seeming names and titles that are designed to give the messages credibility. 
Depending on the specific attack used, the message typically includes a link for 
“additional information,” which will launch a drive-by download or social 
engineering attack when clicked. Other messages include malicious attachments 
instead of links, typically a document file containing an exploit.

Little is known about how and what information STRONTIUM gathers to tailor its 
attacks to specific high-value individuals. As discussed earlier, the user-agent 
and potential fingerprinting information gathered from phishing victims may 
play a part in planning the individual attacks by giving the group insight into 
what software may be in widespread use within the institution. In general, 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015   7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
STRONTIUM can take advantage of a variety of attacks that span general tactics 
and cover a wide range of technologies, including zero-day exploits. 

Zero-day exploits—exploits that target vulnerabilities for which the affected 
software vendor has not yet released a security update—form a significant part 
of STRONTIUM’s arsenal. It is not yet clear whether the group researches 
vulnerabilities and develops the exploits themselves, or purchases them on the 
black market.  

Microsoft researchers have observed STRONTIUM moving swiftly to take

advantage of newly disclosed vulnerabilities; notably, the group 
deployed a number of zero-day exploits disclosed in a July 2015 
leak of information from the security company Hacking Team. In 
other cases, STRONTIUM deployed exploits within days of a 
vendor releasing a security update that addressed the 
associated vulnerability, relying on the fact that not everyone 
installs security updates immediately after they are published.  

The exploits used by STRONTIUM include a wide range of 

products from multiple vendors, including Adobe Flash Player, the Oracle Java 
Runtime Environment (JRE), Microsoft Word and Internet Explorer, and some 
components of the Windows kernel. Figure 5 lists some of the exploits used by 
STRONTIUM in recent campaigns, including a number of zero-day exploits 
(shaded). All of the vulnerabilities listed in Figure 5 were quickly addressed by 
security updates as part of the vendors’ rapid response processes. (See 
“Guidance” on page 16 for information about how organizations can use up-to-
date software to defend against targeted attacks.)

In addition to using zero-day exploits, STRONTIUM also makes use of exploits 
that target older vulnerabilities for which security updates have been available 
for a long time. Microsoft believes that in some cases, the group learns during 
the reconnaissance phase that the targeted institution may be exposed to risks 
by running older or out-of-support platforms and software, by not testing and 
applying security updates quickly, or by not taking advantage of the latest 
mitigations and defense mechanisms shipped with more recent product 
versions—and then acts accordingly.  

In a development observed in October 2015, the shellcode that executes after a 
successful memory corruption exploit displayed a number of characteristics that 
researchers had not observed from the malware previously: 

  API resolution: ROR 0x0D hashing, resolution made just before using the API 

  Downloader: usage of HttpQueryInfo and WININET to fetch remote 

payloads in memory 

  Compression: usage of ntdll!RtlDecompressBuffer()LZNT1 compression for 

remote payloads 

  Privilege escalation: executed as DLL, but in-memory (diskless) 

Figure 6. In-memory decompression and execution of remote payloads performed by STRONTIUM shellcode 

In addition to relying on exploits, STRONTIUM also uses social engineering to 
trick victims into installing malware. Since March of 2015, for example, Microsoft 
has observed STRONTIUM successfully compromising Mozilla Firefox users by 
convincing them to install a malicious browser add-on based on a publicly 
available module (“Bootstrapped Addon Social Engineering Code Execution”) 
developed for the Metasploit security testing framework.

Figure 7. STRONTIUM installs malware via a malicious bootstrapped add-on in Mozilla Firefox 

Establishing control 

After gaining administrative privileges on the computer through an exploit or 
social engineering, STRONTIUM uses a dropper to deploy a backdoor 
component, CORESHELL, which eventually downloads other modules. 
(Microsoft products sometimes detect the primary components as variants in 
the Win32/Foosace family, although the group has used other malware in the 
past.) The DLL backdoor is installed via execution of rundll32 with an export 
named “init” or “InitW.” The dropper deletes itself after execution, while the DLL 
backdoor and any additional components are typically copied under the 
following folders: 

  C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\MSInfo\ 

  C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Local\Microsoft Help\ 

  C:\ProgramData\ 

The dropper also writes the command and control (C&C) configuration 
information to the registry or an encrypted file. This strategy complicates 
forensic discovery of the attacker’s infrastructure if the backdoor DLL is 
discovered, because the configuration information must be located separately.

STRONTIUM ensures that its backdoor will run every time the computer starts by 
creating autostart extensibility point (ASEP) registry entries and shortcuts, which 
differ depending on what the attacker has chosen for the victim and which 
backdoor variant is used. (See “Advanced Malware Cleaning Techniques for the 
IT Professional” on page 96 of Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, Volume 11 
(January–June 2011), available from the Microsoft Download Center, for 
guidance on using Sysinternals tools to monitor ASEPs for signs of malware 
infection.) The most common ASEPs used by STRONTIUM for its malware 
include the following: 

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ 

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ 

Explorer\Shell Folders\ 

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\

  %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application Data\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\

The STRONTIUM backdoor is composed of several pieces with different 
functions. The attacker can deploy a large set of tools to perform tasks including 
key logging, email address and file harvesting, information gathering about the 
local computer, and remote communication with C&C servers. STRONTIUM also 
uses a component that is designed to infect connected USB storage devices, so 
that information can be captured from air-gapped computers that are not on

the network when a user transfers the USB device to the air-gapped computer 
and then back to the network again.

The STRONTIUM group also appears to be active on non-Windows systems. 
Microsoft has seen solid indicators that STRONTIUM used malicious backdoors 
to take control of proxy servers, mail servers, and other systems 
running the Linux operating system. Microsoft also observed the 
group using domains that seem to be customized for different 
operating systems, including mac.softupdates.info and 
linux.softupdates.info. Although Microsoft does not generally 
study attacks on non-Windows systems, a multiplatform attack 
strategy is very much in line with what has been observed about 
STRONTIUM in general—that they have capabilities that cover a

Taking action 

The STRONTIUM backdoor can communicate over different network protocols, 
including HTTP, SMTP, and POP3. Typically, the backdoor tests its connectivity 
with a series of HTTP POST requests to legitimate websites, and then establishes 
communication with its C&C servers. The domains 
STRONTIUM uses for its C&C servers are typically designed 
to avoid attracting attention if administrators notice them 
when reviewing network traffic, such as softupdates.info and 
malwarecheck.info, suggestive of software update and 
malware reputation services. 

In recent incidents during 2015, Microsoft observed 
STRONTIUM using a tunnel component designed to provide 
a remote encrypted interactive shell to a pre-configured IP address using proxy 
software on the victim’s computer, such as the popular open-source Squid 
proxy. The tunneling module, which is customized for different targets, is slightly 
larger than 1 MB and is statically linked with an OpenSSL library. Based on debug 
information left in some samples, some researchers have reported that the 
name of the component may be “XAPS OBJECTIVE” or “XTUNNEL.”4 The C&C 
server for this tunnel could be either hardcoded in the binary or passed as a 
command-line parameter at startup.  

The domains 
STRONTIUM uses 
are designed to 
avoid attracting 
attention.

After gaining a foothold on one computer, STRONTIUM attempts to move 
laterally through the organization by compromising additional computers to 
gain access to more data and high-value targets. STRONTIUM uses publicly 
available tools such as WinExe (a remote command-line execution tool) and 
Mimikatz (a Windows credential gathering tool) to move between computers via 
methods such as Pass the Hash (PtH). In recent incidents Microsoft observed 
STRONTIUM using a customized version of Mimikatz that was recompiled with a 
privilege escalation exploit (CVE-2015-1701, addressed by Security Bulletin 
MS15-051) and stored captured credential information in a dedicated file, pi.log. 

Figure 12. A customized version of Mimikatz storing passwords in the file pi.log 

STRONTIUM has displayed an advanced understanding of military and classified 
government networks, and uses a component that is designed to extract 
information from air-gapped computers. This module registers a device callback

via RegisterDeviceNotification5 and receives a notification every time a USB 
mass storage device is inserted into a compromised computer. Depending on 
the variant deployed, the backdoor may simply harvest the entire contents of 
the USB device and save it on the local computer for later extraction, or it may 
also use Autorun malware to transfer itself to the device so that it can attempt to 
compromise any other computers it is later inserted into, including air-gapped 
computers.6 

Figure 13. The device notification routine registered by a STRONTIUM USB module 

Some STRONTIUM victims have reported the presence of computers running 
Kali Linux on their networks. Kali Linux is a Linux distribution that combines a 
variety of tools for the purpose of penetration testing and security assessment. It 
contains tools for password attacks, sniffing & spoofing, maintaining access, 
hardware hacking, reverse engineering, information gathering, vulnerability 
analysis, wireless attacks, web application attacks, stress testing, and forensic and

6 Changes to the way the AutoRun feature works make it more difficult for this technique to succeed in recent 
versions of Windows. See blogs.technet.com/b/security/archive/2011/06/27/defending-against-autorun-

exploitation analysis. The tool lists within each category are quite extensive and 
the distribution is actively maintained, so that STRONTIUM can always take 
advantage of the latest open-source tools. STRONTIUM does not deploy this 
Linux distribution on an existing computer that belongs to the targeted 
institution; rather, it uses a VPN connection to join one of its own Kali Linux 
computers to the victim’s network, possibly using the tunnel component that 
was previously deployed. This approach allows STRONTIUM to only ephemerally 
expose its toolset to the victim’s network. 

Guidance 

STRONTIUM is a very challenging adversary for a targeted institution to defend 
against: it possesses a broad range of technical exploitation capabilities, 
significant access to resources such as previously undiscovered zero-day 
exploits, and the determination to keep up an attack for months or years until it 
succeeds. Nevertheless, there are steps an organization can take to significantly 
reduce its attack surface and decrease the probability of a successful 
compromise. 

STRONTIUM is a 
challenging 
adversary for a 
targeted institution 
to defend against. 

 
Stay up-to-date on vendor security updates and deploy 
them quickly after they are released. All of the exploits discussed 
in this section have been addressed by security updates from 
Microsoft and other vendors. STRONTIUM depends heavily on 
the presence of out-of-date software installations inside target 
institutions, so keeping software up-to-date denies the group 
the use of some of its most effective tools. 

  Take advantage of the mitigations built into your software. Recent versions 

of Windows and other software include critical mitigations that render many 
of STRONTIUM’s exploits ineffective when deployed. Figure 5 on page 8 lists 
a number of zero-day exploits that STRONTIUM has used in recent 
campaigns. Most of these exploits will fail if tried on a computer running the 
latest versions of Windows and Office, even without security updates that 
address the vulnerabilities: 

  The STRONTIUM exploits that target CVE-2015-1641 and CVE-2015-

2424, which affect Microsoft Word and have been addressed by Security 

Bulletins MS15-033 and MS15-070 respectively, depend on static hard-

coded ROP chains that fail when address space layout randomization

(ASLR) is enabled. Office 2013 and Office 2016 both run with ASLR 

enabled by default, rendering these exploits ineffective.

  The exploit targeting CVE-2015-3043, a vulnerability in Adobe Flash 

Player addressed by Adobe Security Bulletin APSB15-06, fails in Internet 

Explorer running on an up-to-date installation of Windows 8.1 or 

Windows 10 because of Control Flow Guard, a mitigation introduced in a 

Windows 8.1 security update in November 2014. Control Flow Guard 

mitigates virtual function hijacking attempts such as the one involving 

the cancel() method shown in Figure 15.

addressed by Security Bulletin MS15-051, and CVE-2015-2387, 

addressed by Security Bulletin MS15-077) could not work in Windows 8 

and newer platforms running on hardware that supports Supervisor 

Mode Execution Protection (SMEP) and other kernel mitigations.7 In fact, 

the exploit is coded to abort execution if running on an operating 

system other than Windows 7.

Figure 16. STRONTIUM's CVE-2015-1701 exploit terminates execution on the newest versions of Windows 

  Enforce segregation of privileges on user accounts and apply all possible 
safety measures to protect Admin accounts from being compromised; 
STRONTIUM relies on pass-the-hash techniques and elevation of privileges 
to successfully move laterally across networks. See “Mitigating Pass-the-
Hash (PtH) Attacks and Other Credential Theft, Version 2,” available at the 
Microsoft Download Center, for more information. 

 

In enterprise environments in which isolated computer networks (air-
gapped) and Internet connected networks co-exist, enforce strong policies 
to prevent sharing and usage of removable media across the air gap. 

  Conduct enterprise software security awareness training, and build 

awareness about malware infection prevention. STRONTIUM heavily relies 
on social engineering to entice individual targets into clicking links to 
malware. Security training can raise awareness around this attack vector. 

 

Institute multi-factor authentication. As STRONTIUM extensively uses 
credential-stealing spear phishing attacks, multi-factor authentication can 
be an effective tool to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are 
stolen.  

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015   19 

 
 
 
  Prepare your network to be forensically ready, so that you can achieve 
containment and recovery if a compromise occurs. A forensically ready 
network that records authentications, password changes, and other 
significant network events can help to quickly identify affected systems. 

  Keep personnel and personal data private. STRONTIUM uses open-source 
intelligence (OSINT) to obtain its initial lists of victims, which might include 
things like name and email address, but can expand into employment 
information and other items of interest. These are all pieces of information 
STRONTIUM can use to devise a realistic attack. The more information 
STRONTIUM has available, the better they can target you. Make sure your 
email is kept confidential and privacy settings on social media don’t disclose 
sensitive information publicly.

Focus on Brazil: 
Win32/Banload and Banking 
Malware 

Online banking is big business in Brazil, where more than half 
of all banking transactions have been made using Internet-
connected devices in recent years.8 Unfortunately, the 
popularity of online banking in Brazil has drawn the attention 
of criminals, who have made the country a world capital for 
banking malware for the last several years. 

Win32/Banload, the most commonly encountered malware family in Brazil in 
2Q15, is a generic detection for threats that download malware designed to 
steal banking credentials, which themselves are usually identified as other 
threats. (Encounter rates for these related threats are generally much lower than 
for Banload, in part because Microsoft real-time security products block Banload 
variants before they can download additional malware; therefore, examining 
Banload encounter rates is a useful proxy for understanding 
the banking malware problem in general.) Together, Banload 
and its related families have been a major part of the 
malware problem in Brazil for nearly ten years. 

Distribution and trends 

Although some variants have been found to target banks 
elsewhere, Banload remains an almost exclusively Brazilian 
threat. More than 93 percent of Banload encounters in 2Q15 
occurred in Brazil, and the encounter rate for Banload in 
Brazil was 2.1 percent in 2Q15, compared to 0.16 percent in Portugal, the 
location with the second highest Banload encounter rate. While Banload was the

worldwide. 

Figure 17. The top ten countries/regions encountering Win32/Banload in 2Q15 

Banload has consistently been encountered at much higher rates in Brazil than 
in the rest of the world. Over the past six quarters the encounter rate for 
Banload in Brazil has fluctuated between 1.0 percent and 2.1 percent, while the 
worldwide Banload encounter rate has ranged between 0.06 percent and 0.11 
percent. Despite a generally rising trend that accelerated in 2Q15, the 
fluctuations shown in Figure 18 are fairly typical for Banload and do not 
necessarily presage significantly increased encounter rates in the future.

Propagation and technical details 

Threats detected as Banload are created and distributed by many different 
parties, who may have little or no connection to each other. Most variants 
operate in similar ways. Banload might be installed by other malware, or use 
social engineering to trick the user into launching it. After it is installed, it 
contacts a remote host and downloads additional files, which then attempt to 
steal banking credentials and transmit them back to the attacker. Banload 
variants have been observed to connect to many different 
remote hosts, including malicious sites as well as legitimate 
sites that have been compromised. As with many other 
malware families, the hosts are not confined to any particular 
region; attackers typically establish malicious hosts wherever 
a vulnerable server can be found to compromise.  

Some Banload variants check the configured system 
language upon installation and only download additional 
files if it is set to Portuguese. Although Banload usually does not attempt to steal 
banking credentials itself, many variants transmit other details about the 
computer environment to the attacker, such as the computer name, user name, 
and Windows version. 

Many Banload 
variants attempt to 
disable security 
products installed 
on the computer.

Many Banload variants attempt to disable security products installed on the 
computer, including G-Buster Browser Defense, a browser add-on that many 
large Brazilian banks provide to their customers to protect banking sessions 
from malware. Some variants modify the registry so that Banload will 
automatically launch each time the computer is started. 

Win32/Banker and credential stealers 

The malware threats downloaded by Banload variants are often detected as 
Win32/Banker and Win32/Bancos. Banker and Bancos are generic detections for 
data-stealing trojans that capture online banking credentials, such as account 
names and passwords, and relay the captured information to a remote attacker. 
As with Banload, these threats are created by many different people who often 
have no connection to each other apart from their common purpose of stealing 
banking credentials. Banker and Bancos variants typically monitor browser 
activity for banking sessions involving large and well-known Brazilian banks, 
including:  

  Banco Bradesco (bradesco.com.br) 

  Banco do Brasil (bb.com.br) 

  Banco do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (banrisul.com.br) 

  Banco Itaú (itau.com.br) 

  Banco Safra (safra.com.br) 

  Banco Santander (santander.com.br) 

  Caixa Econômica Federal (caixa.gov.br) 

  Citibank (citibank.com.br) 

  HSBC (hsbc.com.br) 

As with Banload, many Banker and Bancos variants attempt to disable security 
products installed on the computer, including G-Buster Browser Defense, and 
modify the registry so the malware will automatically launch each time the 
computer is started. 

Win32/BrobanDel and boleto malware 

Another type of banking malware that has affected Brazil recently targets 
boletos bancários, a popular payment method there. A boleto bancário, usually 
simply called a boleto, is a payment order generated by a merchant or other 

24  WIN32/BANLOAD AND BANKING MALWARE 

 
 
payee, similar to an invoice. Boletos are popular in Brazil because they provide a 
mechanism for people to pay bills or other debts without having a bank 
account; they can be paid in cash at a wide range of locations, including banks, 
post offices, and supermarkets. In recent years, online boletos have become 
popular: payers receive them over the Internet and can either pay them 
electronically from a bank account or can print them out for payment like 
conventional paper boletos. It is these online boletos that have been targeted 
by a new type of banking malware. 

Figure 19. An example of a boleto bancário, a popular method of payment in Brazil 

Every boleto has a unique identification number that specifies the bank, payee, 
and amount to be paid, among other information. The identification number is 
printed at the top of the boleto and encoded as a barcode at the bottom. A 
typical boleto malware variant (often detected as Win32/BrobanDel) installs itself 
as a browser add-on and monitors webpages for patterns that match a boleto. 
When it identifies a boleto, it alters the identification number so that when the 
recipient pays it, the money will be paid into an account controlled by the 
attacker, rather than the payee’s account. The malware may re-encode the 
barcode to match the altered number, or simply corrupt it so that it cannot be 
optically scanned, requiring the cashier to enter the identification number by 
hand.

New variants of Banload and the other families discussed in this section are 
discovered every day, and variants discovered in the future may exhibit different 
behaviors than those described here. Visit the Microsoft Malware Protection 
Center encyclopedia at https://www.microsoft.com/mmpc for the latest 
information about this and other threats. 

Guidance 

Effectively protecting users from malware requires an active effort on the part of 
organizations and individuals. For in-depth guidance, see “Top security 
solutions” at the Microsoft Malware Protection Center website at 
www.microsoft.com/mmpc. 

Specific steps that IT administrators and individual users can take to protect 
themselves from malware include the following: 

 

Install security updates for all software as soon as is practical. Promptly 
installing security updates remains one of the best ways to defend against 
newly discovered threats. 

  Configure computers to use Microsoft Update rather than Windows Update 
to automatically receive updates for a wide range of Microsoft products. 
Ensure that security updates from other software vendors are distributed 
automatically when possible. 

26  WIN32/BANLOAD AND BANKING MALWARE 

 
 
 
 

Install a comprehensive, real-time antimalware product from a reputable 
vendor on all of your organization’s computers, and ensure that they receive 
frequent, regular definition or signature file updates. 

  Take advantage of advanced Windows security features such as User 

Account Control and AppLocker to prevent unauthorized programs from 
running without permission. 

  Use caution when clicking links to webpages and when opening 

attachments to email messages. 

  Use a web browser such as Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge that offers 

advanced protection against phishing and malicious webpages.

Vulnerabilities 

Vulnerabilities, in the context of computer security, are 
weaknesses in software that could allow an attacker to 
compromise the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of the 
software. Some of the worst vulnerabilities allow attackers to 
exploit the compromised system by causing it to run malicious 
code without the user’s knowledge. 

Industry-wide vulnerability disclosures 

A disclosure, as the term is used in the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, is 
the revelation of a software vulnerability to the public at large. Disclosures can 
come from a variety of sources, including publishers of the affected software, 
security software vendors, independent security researchers, and even malware 
creators. 

The information in this section is compiled from vulnerability disclosure data that 
is published in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), the US government’s 
repository of standards-based vulnerability management data at nvd.nist.gov. 
The NVD represents all disclosures that have a published CVE (Common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifier.9  

Figure 21 illustrates the number of vulnerability disclosures across the software 
industry for each half-year period since 2H12. (See “About this report” on page v 
for an explanation of the reporting period nomenclature used in this report.) 

9 CVE entries are subject to ongoing revision as software vendors and security researchers publish more 
information about vulnerabilities. For this reason, the statistics presented here may differ slightly from 
comparable statistics published in previous volumes of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report.

Figure 21. Industrywide vulnerability disclosures, 2H12–1H15 

  After increasing significantly in 2H14, vulnerability disclosures across the 

industry decreased 34.7 percent in 1H15 to just under 3,000, very close to 
the level seen a year previously in 1H14. 

  The large increase in disclosures in 2H14 was predominantly the result of 
work performed by the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) 
Coordination Center (CERT/CC) in September and October 2014 to scan 
Android applications in the Google Play Store for man-in-the-middle 
vulnerabilities using an automated tool.10 CERT/CC determined that 
thousands of Android apps fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided 
by HTTPS connections, which could allow an attacker on the same network 
as an Android device to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the 
device.11 This project resulted in the creation of almost 1400 individual CVEs 
affecting thousands of different publishers of Android apps and code 
libraries. With no comparable research projects having been undertaken in 
1H15, the total number of disclosures returned to a more typical level, as 
expected.

Vulnerability severity 

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a standardized, platform-
independent scoring system for rating IT vulnerabilities. The CVSS base metric 
assigns a numeric value between 0 and 10 to vulnerabilities according to 
severity, with higher scores representing greater severity. (See A Complete 
Guide to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 2.0 at first.org for 
more information.) 

Figure 22. Industrywide vulnerability disclosures by severity, 2H12–1H15 

  Disclosures of medium-severity vulnerabilities—those with CVSS scores 

from 4 to 7.9—dropped by nearly half from 2H14, but remained the most 
common type of vulnerability in 1H15. A research project in 2H14 uncovered 
SSL vulnerabilities in a large number of Android apps in the Google Play 
store, explaining the rise and subsequent fall of medium-severity 
vulnerabilities. (See page 32 for more information about this project.) 

  By contrast, the number of disclosures of high-severity and low-severity 

vulnerabilities remained mostly stable, with both categories increasing by 
less than 2 percent from 1H14 to 2H14. High-severity vulnerabilities 
accounted for the second-highest share of vulnerability disclosures in 1H15, 
at 32.5 percent, and low-severity vulnerabilities accounted for the smallest 
share, at 10.4 percent.

  As shown in Figure 23, the highest-severity vulnerabilities—those scoring 

9.9 or higher on the CVSS scale—accounted for 7.6 percent of all 
vulnerabilities in 1H15.

Vulnerability complexity 

Some vulnerabilities are easier to exploit than others, and vulnerability 
complexity is an important factor to consider in determining the magnitude of 
the threat that a vulnerability poses. A high-severity vulnerability that can only 
be exploited under very specific and rare circumstances might require less 
immediate attention than a lower-severity vulnerability that can be exploited 
more easily. 

The CVSS assigns each vulnerability a complexity ranking of Low, Medium, or 
High. (See A Complete Guide to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System 
Version 2.0 at first.org for more information about the CVSS complexity ranking 
system.) Figure 24 shows complexity trends for vulnerabilities disclosed since 
2H12. Note that Low complexity in Figure 24 indicates greater risk, just as High 
severity indicates greater risk in Figure 22.

of disclosures, at 56.3 percent of all disclosures.  

  Medium-complexity vulnerabilities decreased 54.9 

percent from 2H14 to 1H15 to account for 42.4 percent of 
all vulnerabilities for the period. A research project in 
2H14 uncovered SSL vulnerabilities in a large number of 
Android apps in the Google Play Store, explaining the 
increase and subsequent decrease of medium-
complexity vulnerabilities. (See page 32 for more 
information about this project.)

Operating system, browser, and application vulnerabilities 

Comparing vulnerabilities that affect a computer’s operating system to 
vulnerabilities that affect other components, such as applications and utilities, 
requires a determination of whether the affected component is considered part 
of the operating system. This determination is not always simple and 
straightforward, given the componentized nature of modern operating systems.

Some programs (media players, for example) ship by default with some 
operating system software but can also be downloaded from the software 
vendor’s website and installed individually. Linux distributions, in particular, are 
often assembled from components developed by different teams, many of 
which provide crucial operating functions such as a graphical user interface 
(GUI) or Internet browsing. 

To facilitate analysis of operating system and browser vulnerabilities, the 
Microsoft Security Intelligence Report distinguishes among four different kinds of 
vulnerabilities: 

  Core operating system vulnerabilities are those with at least one operating 
system platform enumeration (“/o”) in the NVD that do not also have any 
application platform enumerations (“/a”).12 

  Operating system application vulnerabilities are those with at least one /o 

platform enumeration and at least one /a platform enumeration listed in the 
NVD, except as described in the next bullet point. 

  Browser vulnerabilities are those that affect components defined as part of a 
web browser, including web browsers such as Internet Explorer and Apple’s 
Safari that ship with operating systems, along with third-party browsers such 
as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. 

  Other application vulnerabilities are those with at least one /a platform 

enumeration in the NVD that do not have any /o platform enumerations, 
except as described in the previous bullet point.

Guidance: Developing secure software 

The Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) (www.microsoft.com/sdl) is a free 
software development methodology that incorporates security and privacy best 
practices throughout all phases of the development process, with the goal of 
protecting software users. Using such a methodology can help reduce the 
number and severity of vulnerabilities in software and help manage 
vulnerabilities that might be discovered after deployment.  

“Life in the Digital Crosshairs,” at sdlstory.com, is a multimedia presentation that 
explores the genesis and development of the SDL from its origins in the 
Windows team’s well-documented all-hands security push in the early 2000s. It 
includes interviews with several of the pivotal figures in the history of the SDL 
and Microsoft’s focus on secure software. Security professionals and anyone else 
with an interest in secure development are likely to find the site invaluable for 
putting the SDL into historical context and understanding what the future holds.

Exploits 

An exploit is a piece of code that uses software vulnerabilities 
to access information on a computer or install malware. 
Exploits target vulnerabilities in operating systems, web 
browsers, applications, or software components that are 
installed on a computer.  

In some scenarios, targeted components are add-ons that may be pre-installed 
by the computer manufacturer before the computer is sold. A user may not 
even use the vulnerable add-on or be aware that it is installed. In addition, some 
software has no facility for updating itself, so even if the software vendor 
publishes an update that fixes the vulnerability, the user may not know that the 
update is available or how to obtain it and therefore remains vulnerable to 
attack.13 

Encounter rate is 
the percentage of 
computers running 
Microsoft real-time 
security products 
that report a mal-
ware encounter. 

Software vulnerabilities are enumerated and documented in the 
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list (cve.mitre.org), 
a standardized repository of vulnerability information. Here and 
throughout this report, exploits are labeled with the CVE 
identifier that pertains to the affected vulnerability, if applicable. 
In addition, exploits that affect vulnerabilities in Microsoft 
software are labeled with the Microsoft Security Bulletin number 
that pertains to the vulnerability, if applicable.14 

Microsoft real-time security products can detect and block 
attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities whether the computer 
is affected by the vulnerabilities or not. For example, the CVE-2010-2568 CplLnk 
vulnerability has never affected Windows 8, but if a Windows 8 user receives a 
malicious file that attempts to exploit that vulnerability, Windows Defender is 
designed to detect and block it anyway. Encounter data provides important 
information about which products and vulnerabilities are being targeted by

attackers, and by what means. However, the statistics presented in this report 
should not be interpreted as evidence of successful exploit attempts, or of the 
relative vulnerability of computers to different exploits. 

Figure 27 shows the prevalence of different types of exploits detected by 
Microsoft antimalware products from 3Q14 to 2Q15, by encounter rate. 
Encounter rate is the percentage of computers running Microsoft real-time 
security products that report a malware encounter. For example, the encounter 
rate for Java exploit attempts in 2Q15 was 0.35 percent, meaning that 0.35 
percent of computers running Microsoft real-time security software in 2Q15 
encountered Java exploit attempts, and 99.65 percent did not. In other words, a 
computer selected at random would have had about a 0.35 percent chance of 
encountering a Java exploit attempt in 2Q15. Only computers whose users have 
opted in to provide data to Microsoft are considered when calculating 
encounter rates.15 See page 58 for more information about the encounter rate 
metric.

* Figures for exploit kits, Java, and Adobe Flash Player exploits are affected by IExtensionValidation in Internet Explorer, which blocks 
many threats before they are encountered. See page 55 for more information.

 
1Q15 and previous periods to become the third most commonly 
encountered exploit category in 2Q15, mostly because of 
encounters involving Win32/Sdbby. Sdbby is a generic 

detection for malware that bypasses the User Account Control (UAC) 
prompt to gain administrative privileges on a computer. It was encountered 
at very low volumes in 1Q15, then became the fourth most commonly 
encountered exploit family in 2Q15. 

  The number of encounters involving other types of exploits remained mostly 
stable during the second half of the year, and each accounted for a small 
percentage of total exploits.

Totals for individual vulnerabilities do not include exploits that were detected as part of exploit kits. 

  Exploit kits accounted for six of the 10 most commonly encountered exploits 
during 1H15. See “Exploit kits” on page 44 for more information about 
exploit kits. 

  Exploits targeting the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) have gone from 

seven of the top 10 individual exploits detected in 2H13 to none in 1H15. A 
number of changes that were made to Java and Internet Explorer over the 
past two years have made it much more difficult for attackers to take 
advantage of Java-based vulnerabilities, which is the most likely explanation 
for this significant decrease. (See “Java exploits” on page 47 for more 
information.) 

  CVE-2010-2568, the most commonly targeted individual vulnerability in 

1H15, is a vulnerability in Windows Shell. Detections are often identified as 
variants in the Win32/CplLnk family, although several other malware families 
attempt to exploit the vulnerability as well. An attacker exploits CVE-2010-
2568 by creating a malformed shortcut file—typically distributed through 
social engineering or other methods—that forces a vulnerable computer to 
load a malicious file when the shortcut icon is displayed in Windows 
Explorer. The vulnerability was first discovered being used by the malware 
family Win32/Stuxnet in mid-2010, and it has since been exploited by a 
number of other families, many of which predated the disclosure of the 
vulnerability and were subsequently adapted to attempt to exploit it.

the issue, and Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 have never been vulnerable to 
exploits of CVE-2010-2568. 

  HTML/IframeRef is a generic detection for specially formed HTML inline 

frame (IFrame) tags that redirect to remote websites that contain malicious 
content. More properly considered exploit downloaders than true exploits, 
these malicious pages use a variety of techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in 
browsers and plug-ins. The only commonality is that the attacker uses an 
inline frame to deliver the exploits to users. The exact exploit delivered and 
detected by one of these inline frames might be changed frequently. 

  CVE-2014-6332 is a vulnerability in Windows Object Linking and Embedding 
(OLE) that can be used to launch remote attacks on a computer through 
Internet Explorer in some circumstances. Microsoft released Security Bulletin 
MS14-064 in November 2014 to address this issue. See “The life and times of 
an exploit” on pages 3–10 of Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, Volume 
18 (July–December 2014), available from the Microsoft Download Center, for 
more information about this vulnerability and what Microsoft has done to 
mitigate it. 

Exploit kits 

Exploit kits are collections of exploits bundled together and sold as commercial 
software or as a service. Prospective attackers buy or rent exploit kits on 
malicious hacker forums and through other illegitimate outlets. A typical kit 
comprises a collection of webpages that contain exploits for several 
vulnerabilities in popular web browsers and browser add-ons. When the 
attacker installs the kit on a malicious or compromised web server, visitors who 
don’t have the appropriate security updates installed are at risk of having their 
computers compromised through drive-by download attacks. (See page 105 for 
more information about drive-by downloads.)

of several top web-based exploit kits and techniques during each of the four 
most recent quarters.

  Overall, encounters with Java exploits continued to decrease significantly in 
1H15. This decrease is likely caused by several important changes in the way 
web browsers evaluate and execute Java applets: 

  The IExtensionValidation interface in Internet Explorer 11, released in late 

IExtensionValidation 
in Internet Explorer 
11 provides a 
mechanism for se-
curity software to 
validate that a 
webpage is safe 
before allowing 
instantiation of 
ActiveX controls. 

2013, provides a mechanism for security software to validate 

that a webpage is safe before allowing instantiation of ActiveX 

controls, such as the control that hosts embedded Java applets. 

If a webpage is determined to be malicious, the ActiveX controls 

are blocked from loading, and the actual Java exploit itself is 

therefore never encountered. (See “Exploit detection with 

Internet Explorer and IExtensionValidation” on page 55 for more 

information.) Subsequent Internet Explorer security updates 

released in 2014 added an isolated heap mechanism and a 

deferred-free method to mitigate use-after-free bugs, which 

further hardened Internet Explorer against Java exploitation. 

 

Beginning with Java 7 update 51, released in January 

2014, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) requires Java applets 

running in web browsers to be digitally signed by default. 

 

In September 2014, Microsoft published updates for versions 8 through 

11 of Internet Explorer to begin blocking out-of-date ActiveX controls, 

including controls that host older versions of the JRE in the browser. As 

explained in this section, the most commonly encountered Java exploits 

all target vulnerabilities that were addressed with security updates years 

ago, but remain present in out-of-date Java installations. When a 

webpage attempts to load one of the vulnerable versions of Java in 

Internet Explorer with the update applied, the control is blocked by 

default and the user is urged to update Java to a more secure version. 

Figure 33. Internet Explorer blocks out-of-date ActiveX controls from running 

  CVE-2012-1723, the most commonly encountered individual Java exploit in 

2Q15 and the second most common in 1Q15, is a type-confusion 
vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that is exploited by 
tricking the JRE into treating one type of variable like another type. Oracle 
confirmed the existence of the vulnerability in June 2012, and addressed it 

48  EXPLOITS 

 
 
 
the same month with its June 2012 Critical Patch Update. The vulnerability 
was observed being exploited in the wild beginning in early July 2012, and 
has been used in a number of exploit kits.  

For more information about this exploit, see the entry 
“The rise of a new Java vulnerability - CVE-2012-1723” 
(August 1, 2012) in the Microsoft Malware Protection 
Center (MMPC) blog at blogs.technet.com/mmpc. 

  Obfuscator is a generic detection for programs that have 
been modified by malware obfuscation, often in an 
attempt to avoid detection by security software. Files 
identified as Java/Obfuscator can represent exploits that 
target many different Java vulnerabilities.

disclosed in March 2010 and addressed by Oracle with a 
security update the same month. The vulnerability was 
previously exploited by some versions of the Blackhole exploit kit (detected 
as JS/Blacole), which has been inactive in recent years. 

  CVE-2012-0507 allows an unsigned Java applet to gain elevated permissions 

and potentially have unrestricted access to a host system outside its 
sandbox environment. The vulnerability is a logic error that allows attackers 
to run code with the privileges of the current user, which means that an 
attacker can use it to perform reliable exploitation on other platforms that 
support the JRE, including Apple Mac OS X, Linux, VMWare, and others. 
Oracle released a security update in February 2012 to address the issue. 

  CVE-2013-0422 first appeared in January 2013 as a zero-day vulnerability. 
CVE-2013-0422 is a package access check vulnerability that allows an 
untrusted Java applet to access code in a trusted class, which then loads the 
attacker’s own class with elevated privileges. Oracle published a security 
update to address the vulnerability on January 13, 2013.

Operating system exploits 

Although most operating system exploits detected by Microsoft security 
products are designed to affect the platforms on which the security products 
run, malicious or infected files that affect other operating systems are sometimes 
downloaded. Figure 34 shows trends for the individual exploits most commonly 
detected and blocked or removed during each of the past four quarters.

  Win32/CplLnk, an exploit that targets a vulnerability in Windows Shell, 

remained the most commonly encountered operating system exploit in 
1H15. An attacker exploits the vulnerability (CVE-2010-2568) by creating a 
malformed shortcut file that forces a vulnerable computer to load a 
malicious file when the shortcut icon is displayed in Windows Explorer. 
Microsoft released Security Bulletin MS10-046 in August 2010 to address this 
issue. 

  CVE-2014-6332 is a vulnerability in Windows Object Linking and Embedding

more information about this vulnerability and what Microsoft has done to 
mitigate it. 

  Three of the five most commonly encountered operating system exploits on 
Windows computers in 1H15 actually target the Android mobile operating 
system published by Google and the Open Handset Alliance. Microsoft 
security products detect these threats when Android devices or storage 
cards are connected to computers running Windows, or when Android 
users knowingly or unknowingly download infected or malicious programs 
to their computers before transferring the software to their devices. Most 
detections that affect Android involve exploits that enable an attacker or 
other user to obtain root privileges on vulnerable Android devices. Device 
owners sometimes use such exploits intentionally to gain 
access to additional functionality (a practice often called 
rooting or jailbreaking), but these exploits can also be 
used by attackers to infect devices with malware that 
bypasses many typical security systems. 

  Unix/Lotoor is an exploit family that exploits 

vulnerabilities in the Android operating system to gain 

root privileges on a mobile device. Google published 

a source code update in March 2011 that addressed 

the vulnerability. 

  CVE-2011-1823 is sometimes called the GingerBreak 

vulnerability because of its use by a popular rooting 

application of that name. It is also used by 

Three of the five 
most commonly 
encountered oper-
ating system ex-
ploits on Windows 
computers in 1H15 
actually target the 
Android mobile 
operating system. 

AndroidOS/GingerMaster, a malicious program that can allow a remote 

attacker to gain access to the mobile device. GingerMaster might be 

bundled with clean applications, and includes an exploit for the CVE-

2011-1823 vulnerability disguised as an image file. Google published a 

source code update in May 2011 that addressed the vulnerability. 

  CVE-2011-3874 can also be used to gain root privileges on devices 

running some versions of Android. Google published a source code 

update in November 2011 that addressed the vulnerability.

Document exploits 

Document exploits are exploits that target vulnerabilities in the way a document 
editing or viewing application processes a particular file format. Figure 35 shows 
encounter rates for individual exploits. 

Figure 35. Individual document exploits detected and blocked by Microsoft real-time antimalware products, 3Q14–2Q15 

  Most detections of exploits that affect Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat 
were associated with the exploit family Win32/Pdfjsc, a detection for PDF 
files containing malicious JavaScript that targets CVE-2010-0188 and other 
vulnerabilities. Adobe released Security Bulletin APSB10-07 in February 2010 
to address CVE-2010-0188. Pdfjsc and related exploits were particularly 
prevalent in eastern Europe. Pdfjsc mostly targets older Java vulnerabilities, 
so attackers may find it less useful as more computers are updated to newer 
versions of Java, which could explain the decrease in encounters over the 
past several quarters.

  Encounters involving Obfuscator variants that target Adobe Flash Player 

increased from very low levels in 1Q15 to become the largest source of Flash 
Player-related exploit encounters in 2Q15. Most of these encounters 
involved two newly discovered threats: Exploit:SWF/Obfuscator.K targets 
CVE-2014-8439, CVE-2015-0311, CVE-2015-0313, and CVE-2015-0359; 
Exploit:SWF/Obfuscator.L mainly targets CVE-2015-0336. 

  CVE-2014-0515, the most commonly exploited Adobe Flash Player 

vulnerability in 1Q15 and the second most common in 1H15 overall, is a 
buffer overflow vulnerability. Adobe released Security Bulletin APSB14-13 on 
April 28, 2014 to address the issue. 

  CVE-2015-0359, a double free vulnerability, was first disclosed in April 2015 
and became the second most commonly encountered Adobe Flash Player 
exploit in the second quarter. Adobe released Security Bulletin APSB15-06 
on April 14 to address the issue. 

  CVE-2014-0497 is an integer underflow vulnerability. Adobe released 
Security Bulletin APSB14-04 on February 4, 2014 to address the issue.

  Exploits targeting CVE-2013-7331, a vulnerability affecting the 

Microsoft.XMLDOM ActiveX control in Internet Explorer, accounted for the 
largest share of browser-related exploits encountered in 1H15. Exploiting this 
vulnerability allows an attacker to confirm the existence or nonexistence of 
arbitrarily specified paths and hostnames in the local environment. Microsoft 
published Security Bulletin MS14-052 in September 2014 to address the 
issue. 

  Exploits targeting vulnerabilities addressed by Security Bulletin MS09-002, 
published by Microsoft in February 2009, accounted for the second largest 
share of browser-related exploits encountered in 1H15. Of these, most 
targeted CVE-2009-0075, an uninitialized memory corruption vulnerability 
in Internet Explorer 7. 

  Encounters involving exploits targeting CVE-2013-2551, a use-after-free 

vulnerability in versions 6 through 10 of Internet Explorer, accounted for the 
largest share of browser-related exploit encounters in 2H14, then fell to 
negligible levels in 1H15 as exploit kit authors dropped them in favor of 
exploits targeting CVE-2013-7331.

Exploit detection with Internet Explorer and IExtensionValidation 

IExtensionValidation is an interface introduced in Internet Explorer 11 that real-
time security software can implement to block ActiveX controls from loading on 
malicious pages. When Internet Explorer loads a webpage that includes ActiveX 
controls, if the security software has implemented IExtensionValidation, the 
browser calls the security software to scan the HTML and script content on the 
page before loading the controls themselves. If the security software determines 
that the page is malicious (for example, if it identifies the page as an exploit kit 
landing page), it can direct Internet Explorer to prevent individual controls or the 
entire page from loading. 

Figure 38. Internet Explorer 11 can block pages that contain ActiveX controls if security software determines that the page is malicious 

Figure 39 shows the types of ActiveX controls identified on malicious webpages 
in Internet Explorer 11 for each quarter in 2014.

  Adobe Flash Player objects were the most commonly detected type of 
object hosted on malicious pages in each of the past four quarters. 

  After accounting for a high of 45.3 percent of object detections in 3Q14, 

Adobe Flash 
objects were the 
most commonly 
detected type of 
object hosted on 
malicious pages. 

detections of Java applets on malicious pages decreased to just 
0.5 percent of detections by 2Q15. A number of changes that 
have been made to Java and Internet Explorer over the past two 
years have made it much more difficult for attackers to take 
advantage of Java-based vulnerabilities, which is the most likely 
explanation for this significant decrease. (See “Java exploits” on 
page 47 for more information.) 

Silverlight, Adobe Reader, and other malicious objects 

 
each accounted for less than 3 percent of object detections 

each quarter. 

Exploits used in targeted attacks 

A targeted attack is an attack against the computers or networks of a specific 
group of companies or individuals. This type of attack usually attempts to gain 
access to the computer or network before trying to steal information or disrupt 
the infected computers. Figure 40 lists some of the exploits Microsoft has 
observed being used in targeted attacks in 1H15.

Malware and unwanted 
software 

Most attempts by malware to infect computers are 
unsuccessful. More than three-quarters of Internet-connected 
personal computers worldwide are protected by real-time 
security software that constantly monitors the computers and 
network traffic for threats and blocks them before they can 
infect the computers, if possible. Therefore, a comprehensive 
understanding of the malware landscape requires 
consideration of infection attempts that are blocked as well as 
infections that are removed.  

Microsoft uses two different metrics to measure malware and unwanted 
software prevalence:16 

  Encounter rate is simply the percentage of computers running Microsoft 

real-time security products that report a malware encounter.17 For example, 
the encounter rate for the malware family JS/Bondat in Mexico in 2Q15 was 
4.2 percent. This data means that, of the computers in Mexico that were 
running Microsoft real-time security software in 2Q15, 4.2 percent reported 
encountering the Bondat family, and 95.8 percent did not. Encountering a 
threat does not mean the computer has been infected. Only computers 
whose users have opted in to provide data to Microsoft are considered 
when calculating encounter rates.18 

16 Microsoft regularly reviews and refines its data collection methodology to improve its scope and accuracy. 
For this reason, the statistics presented in this volume of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report may differ 
slightly from comparable statistics in previous volumes.  
17 Encounter rate does not include threats that are blocked by a web browser before being detected by 
antimalware software. In particular, IExtensionValidation in Internet Explorer 11 enables security software to 
block pages that contain exploits from loading. (See “Exploit detection with Internet Explorer and 
IExtensionValidation” on page 55 for information about IExtensionValidation and the threats it blocks.) For this 
reason, encounter rate figures may not fully reflect all of the threats encountered by computer users. 
18 For information about the products and services that provide data for this report, see “Appendix B: Data 
sources” on page 129.

  Computers cleaned per mille, or CCM, is an infection rate metric that is 
defined as the number of computers cleaned for every 1,000 unique 
computers that run the Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT), a free tool 
distributed through Microsoft update services that removes more than 200 
highly prevalent or serious threats from computers. Because it is not a real-
time tool, the MSRT only detects and removes threats that are already 
present on the computer; it does not block infection attempts as they 
happen. 

Figure 41 illustrates the difference between these two metrics. 

Figure 41. Worldwide encounter and infection rates, 2Q14–2Q15, by quarter 

Figures do not include Brantall, Rotbrow, and Filcout. See “Brantall, Rotbrow, and Filcout” on page 60 for more information. 

As Figure 41 shows, and as one would expect, malware encounters are much 
more common than malware infections. On average, about 17.0 percent of 
reporting computers worldwide encountered malware over the past four 
quarters. At the same time, the MSRT removed malware from about 7.1 out of 
every 1,000 computers, or 0.71 percent. Together, encounter and infection rate 
information can help provide a broader picture of the malware landscape by 
offering different perspectives on how malware propagates and how computers 
get infected.

Brantall, Rotbrow, and Filcout 

Where noted, the figures in this report omit detections of Win32/Brantall, 
Win32/Rotbrow, and Win32/Filcout. These three families were involved in an 
incident in which a rogue developer with access to commercial source code 
modified the source code to serve as a stealth distribution method for malware 
without being detected by major security software vendors. When the 
modification was discovered, it resulted in a significant installed base of 
commercial software being reclassified as malicious, which had an outsized 
effect on infection rates. Microsoft believes that the unmodified infection and 
encounter figures do not create an accurate picture of the worldwide threat 
landscape over the past year and a half. As a result, totals for the Brantall, 
Filcout, and Rotbrow families have been removed from the infection and 
encounter figures presented here where appropriate, as noted. 

See “The Sefnit saga: a timeline” on pages 57–64 of Microsoft Security 
Intelligence Report, Volume 17 (January–June 2014), available from the Microsoft 
Download Center, for a more in-depth explanation of the incident, along with 
detection statistics and a timeline of events. 

Malware and unwanted software worldwide 

The telemetry data generated by Microsoft security products from computers 
whose administrators or users choose to opt in to provide data to Microsoft 
includes information about the location of the computer, as determined by IP 
geolocation. This data makes it possible to compare infection and encounter 
rates, patterns, and trends in different locations around the world.19 

19 For more information about this process, see the entry “Determining the Geolocation of Systems Infected 
with Malware” (November 15, 2011) in the Microsoft Cyber Trust Blog (blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust).

  Locations in Figure 42 are ordered by the number of computers reporting 

detections in 1H15. 

  As Figure 41 on page 59 illustrates, the worldwide encounter rate increased 
slightly in 1Q15 before decreasing again in 2Q15, and this pattern is reflected 
in several of the locations in Figure 42 as well. India, France, Turkey, the 
United Kingdom, Mexico, and Canada all had small encounter rate increases 
in the first quarter of 2015, followed by decreases to around the same level 
as 2Q14. In general, however, encounter rates remained largely stable 
through the first half of 2015 in all of these locations, without any unusually 
large increases or decreases. 

  The browser modifiers Win32/KipodToolsCby and Win32/CouponRuc and 
the adware family Win32/SaverExtension, the three most commonly 
encountered families worldwide in 1H15, were also the three most 
commonly encountered families in the United States, France, Turkey, the 
United Kingdom, Mexico, and Canada, and were all in the top six families 
encountered in Russia and India. See “Threat families” beginning on page 74 
for more information about these and other malware and unwanted 
software families. 

  Encounters in the United States in 1H15 were dominated by unwanted 

software, which accounted for nine of the ten most commonly encountered 
families. Of these, six were browser modifiers, including CouponRuc and 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015   61 

 
 
KipodToolsCby, the first and third most commonly detected threat families 
in the US, respectively. 

The browser modifiers KipodToolsCby, CouponRuc, and Win32/IeEnablerCby 
were the most commonly detected families in Brazil in 1H15. Families that ranked 
unusually high in Brazil included Win32/Banload (ranked fourth in Brazil, 54th 
worldwide), which is usually used to steal login credentials for Brazilian banks, 
and the worm family JS/Proslikefan (14th in Brazil, 101st worldwide). (See 

As is typically the 
case, the threat 
landscape in China 
was dominated by 
malware families 
that are much less 
common 
worldwide. 

“Win32/Banload and Banking Malware” on page 21 for more 
information about Banload in Brazil.) 

 
Encounters in Russia were led by Win32/Peals, a family 
of trojans, and the downloader family Win32/Ogimant, which 
has a Russian-language interface and masquerades as a 
downloader for peer-to-peer and torrent services. Detections of 
Ogimant in Russia decreased from 3.6 percent in 1Q15 to 0.75 
percent in 2Q15, but it remained the second most commonly 
detected family in Russia in 1H15, overall, behind Peals. Other 
families that were unusually common in Russia in 1H15 included 
the trojan family Win32/Radonskra (ranked ninth in Russia, 84th 
worldwide) and the generic trojan detection Win32/Peaac (10th 

in Russia, 48th worldwide). 

  The mix of threats encountered in India and Turkey were largely similar to 
the worldwide mix, but each location also reported significant encounters 
with a threat that appeared to be strongly targeted at a specific region. The 
worm family MSIL/Mofin (ranked 12th in India, 115th worldwide) was 
unusually common in India, where more than 85 percent of all Mofin 
encounters occurred in 1H15. And the trojan family Win32/BeeVry (11th in 
Turkey, 134th worldwide) was unusually common in Turkey, where more 
than 98 percent of all BeeVry encounters occurred in 1H15. 

  As is typically the case, the threat landscape in China in 1H15 was dominated 
by malware families that are much less common worldwide. Of the threats 
most commonly encountered in China, only the generic detections 
Win32/Obfuscator, INF/Autorun, and Win32/Dynamer and the trojan family 
Win32/Ramnit were also commonly encountered worldwide. All of the most 
commonly encountered families in China in 1H15 were malware families. The 
most commonly detected unwanted software family in China 
(KipodToolsCby) ranked 48th there overall. Families that were unusually 

62  MALWARE AND UNWANTED SOFTWARE 

 
 
prevalent in China included the virus DOS/JackTheRipper (ranked second in 
China, 119th worldwide), the downloader HTML/Adodb (fifth in China, 108th 
worldwide), and the worm ALisp/Kenilfe (seventh in China, 125th worldwide). 

  The downloader family W97M/Adnel was unusually prevalent in the United 

Kingdom (ranked 12th in the UK, 98th worldwide). 

  The rogue security software family JS/FakeCall was unusually prevalent in 

Canada (ranked 11th in Canada, 96th worldwide). 

For a different perspective on threat patterns worldwide, Figure 43 shows the 
infection and encounter rates in locations around the world in 2Q15.

  The locations with the highest encounter rates were Pakistan, Indonesia, 

Algeria, Bangladesh, and Nepal. 

  Pakistan, Indonesia, and Algeria also had the highest encounter rates in 

2H14. 

  As in 2H14, exploit kits were relatively rare in the locations with the 

highest encounter rates. JS/Axpergle, the most commonly encountered 

exploit kit worldwide in 1H15, ranked no higher than 34th in any of the 

locations with the highest encounter rates. 

  Unwanted software was highly prevalent in these 

locations, as it was worldwide in 1H15. The browser 

modifiers Win32/KipodToolsCby and 

Win32/CouponRuc and the adware family 

Win32/SaverExtension, the three most commonly

included Win32/Nuqel (ranked 11th in Pakistan, 34th worldwide), a 

worm, and the virus family Win32/Chir (13th in Pakistan, 69th 

worldwide). In both cases, the encounter rate for the family in Pakistan 

was more than twice as high as in any other country or region. 

  Families that were unusually prevalent in Indonesia included the exploit 

Win32/CplLnk (ranked fifth in Indonesia, 20th worldwide) and the virus 

family Win32/Slugin (ranked 13th in Indonesia, 92nd worldwide). 

  Win32/Macoute, a worm, was unusually prevalent in Algeria (ranked 

17th in Algeria, 148th worldwide). Most Macoute encounters worldwide 

took place in Algeria and several other locations in Africa, including 

Senegal, Ghana, and Tunisia. 

  The worm family Win32/Vercuser was unusually prevalent in Bangladesh 

(ranked 14th in Bangladesh, 102nd worldwide) and a number of nearby 

locations, including Nepal, Pakistan, and India. 

  The locations with the highest infection rates were Iraq, Libya, the Palestinian 

territories, Morocco, and Pakistan. 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015   65 

 
 
  The worm family VBS/Jenxcus was the most common malware family 

infecting computers in 1H15 in all of these locations except Morocco, 

where it was second. Infection rates for Jenxcus were particularly high 

across the Middle East, and low in North America and Europe. 

 

Infections involving the backdoor family MSIL/Bladabindi, which ranked 

26th among infecting families worldwide, were particularly common in 

Iraq (where it ranked fourth), Libya (third), the Palestinian territories 

(11th), and Morocco (seventh). Like Jenxcus, Bladabindi had its greatest 

impact in the Middle East. 

 

In Morocco, the most common infecting malware family was the worm 

family Win32/Yeltminky, which had its highest infection rate there (a 

CCM of 23.8 in Morocco in 2Q15, compared to 3.3 in Algeria, the next 

highest location). Yeltminky is a family of worms that spreads by making

  The Nordic countries, including Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and 

Sweden, have perennially been among the healthiest locations in the world 
with regard to malware exposure, as has Japan. In 1H15, the infection and 
encounter rates for these locations were typically about half of the 
worldwide averages. (See the blog entry series “Lessons from Least Infected 
Countries” at blogs.technet.com/b/security/p/series-
lessons-from-least-infected-countries.aspx for more 
information about locations that typically have low 
infection and encounter rates.) 

  All of these locations, even geographically- and 

culturally-distant Japan, had similar encounter and 
infection statistics in 1H15. Unwanted software dominated 
encounters in each location, led by browser modifiers 
Win32/KipodToolsCby, Win32/CouponRuc, and 
Win32/AlterbookSP; adware family Win32/SaverExtension; and software 
bundler Win32/InstalleRex. 

All five locations 
had similar 
encounter and 
infection statistics 
in 1H15. 

 

Infection rates trended up significantly in all five locations in 2Q15 because 
of removals of Win32/CompromisedCert, an advertising program pre-
installed on some Lenovo laptops that installed a compromised trusted root 
certificate, and Win32/IeEnablerCby, a browser modifier that bypasses user

  Threats that are particularly uncommon in these locations include 

Win32/Frethog, a game password stealer that is most prevalent in Asia; 
Win32/Yeltminky, a worm that is most prevalent in the Middle East; 
Win32/Gamarue, a worm that is prevalent in southeast Asia and the Middle 
East; and Win32/Ramnit, a virus that is prevalent in southern and southeast 
Asia. 

Microsoft and partners disrupt the Simda.AT botnet 

On April 12, 2015, Interpol and the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit 
(DNHTCU) announced the disruption of Backdoor:Win32/Simda.AT, a significant 
malware threat affecting more than 770,000 devices in more than 190 countries 
and regions. 

Win32/Simda is a family of threats that can provide an attacker with backdoor 
access to and control of an infected device. They can then steal passwords and 
gather information about the device to send to the attacker. The Simda.AT 
variant first appeared in 2012, and is often downloaded to a vulnerable device 
by a drive-by download. Aside from the information-stealing behavior common 
to Simda variants, Simda.AT redirects search traffic from popular websites such 
as Bing, Google, and Facebook to its own domain, and can download other 
malware from a remote host. Simda was the 55th most commonly encountered 
malware family worldwide in 1H15, with the overwhelming majority of 
encounters involving the Simda.AT variant. 

Figure 48. Average number of Simda-infected devices connecting to the sinkhole each month, April–July, 2015 

68  MALWARE AND UNWANTED SOFTWARE 

 
 
 
Interpol coordinated the operation and the DNHTCU, with the support of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), successfully took down Simda.AT’s active 
command and control infrastructure across four countries including the 
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Russia, and the United States. The Microsoft Malware 
Protection Center (MMPC) and the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) led the 
analysis of the malware threat in partnership with CDI Japan, Kaspersky Lab, and 
Trend Micro. 

The MMPC activated the Coordinated Malware Eradication (CME) platform to 
provide in-depth research, telemetry, samples, and cleaning solutions to law 
enforcement and Microsoft partners. This information helped law enforcement 
take action against Simda.AT and its infrastructure, while providing remediation 
and recovery options for infected devices around the world. 

For more information about the takedown and technical information about the 
Simda.AT backdoor, see the entry “Microsoft partners with Interpol, industry to 
disrupt global malware attack affecting more than 770,000 PCs in past six 
months” (April 12, 2015) on the MMPC blog at blogs.technet.com/mmpc. 

Threat categories 

The MMPC classifies individual threats into types based on a number of factors, 
including how the threat spreads and what it is designed to do. To simplify the 
presentation of this information and make it easier to understand, the Microsoft 
Security Intelligence Report groups these types into categories based on 
similarities in function and purpose.

Figures do not include Brantall, Rotbrow, and Filcout. See “Brantall, Rotbrow, and Filcout” on page 60 for more information. 

  The number of encounters for most categories of malware remained stable 
or decreased throughout the first half of 2015, with the exception of Trojans, 
which increased to 4.5 percent in 2Q15 after dipping slightly in the first 
quarter. Encounters with the three most commonly detected trojan families, 
Win32/Peals, Win32/Kilim, and Win32/Skeeyah, all increased significantly in 
2Q15, contributing to the overall increase, which was partly ameliorated by 
the disruption of the Win32/Ramnit family. See “Threat families” beginning 
on page 74 for more information about these and other malware and 
unwanted software families.

Figures do not include Brantall, Rotbrow, and Filcout. See “Brantall, Rotbrow, and Filcout” on page 60 for more information. 

  Encounters involving browser modifiers more than doubled between 1Q15 
and 2Q15 because of changes to Microsoft detection criteria for unwanted 
software. In January, Microsoft security products began 
detecting as unwanted software browser add-ons that 
limit user control over their browser in a number of ways, 
including disabling certain browser controls, limiting the 
user’s ability to choose their default search provider, and 
bypassing consent dialogs for newly installed add-ons. 
See “Threat families” beginning on page 74 for more 
information about this change. 

Encounters involv-
ing browser modi-
fiers more than 
doubled because 
of changes to 
detection criteria. 

  Encounters involving adware increased from 2.5 percent 

in 4Q14 to 3.7 percent in 1Q15, then fell to 1.6 percent. Much of the increase 
and subsequent decrease was related to Win32/SaverExtension, a browser 
add-on that shows ads in the browser without revealing their source, and 
prevents itself from being removed normally.

  Detections of software bundlers increased slightly in 1Q15 because of 

Win32/InstalleRex, a software bundler that installs other unwanted software 
families. 

Threat categories by location 

Significant differences exist in the types of threats that affect users in different 
parts of the world. The spread of malware can be highly dependent on 
language and socioeconomic factors as well as on the methods used for 
distribution. Some threats are spread using techniques that target people who 
speak a particular language or who use online services that are local to a specific 
geographic region. Other threats target vulnerabilities or operating system 
configurations and applications that are unequally distributed around the world. 

Figure 52 shows the relative prevalence of different categories of malware in 
several locations around the world in 2Q15.

Figure 54. Encounter rate trends for a number of notable malware families in 1H15 

  Win32/Obfuscator, the most commonly encountered threat in 1H15, is a 
generic detection for programs that have been modified by malware 
obfuscation tools. These tools typically use a combination of methods, 
including encryption, compression, and anti-debugging or anti-emulation 
techniques, to alter malware programs in an effort to hinder analysis or 
detection by security products. The output is usually another program that

keeps the same functionality as the original program but with different code, 
data, and geometry. 

  Encounters involving VBS/Jenxcus declined steadily over the past four 

quarters, but it remained the second-most commonly encountered family in 
1H15. Jenxcus is a worm coded in VBScript that opens a backdoor on an 
infected computer, enabling an attacker to control it remotely. In addition to 

Win32/Gamarue, 
the third most 
commonly en-
countered threat in 
1H15, was espe-
cially prevalent in 
southeast Asia and 
the Middle East. 

spreading via removable drives, Jenxcus was often transmitted 
via a fake Adobe Flash Player update from spoofed YouTube 
webpages. Encounters involving Jenxcus decreased significantly 
after the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit launched a takedown 
operation in June of 2014 that successfully disrupted the Jenxcus 
botnet. The original owners of the botnet subsequently left the 
project, but the Jenxcus code is now being used by other 
criminal organizations.  

See “The Microsoft DCU and the legal side of fighting malware” 
on pages 29–32 of Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, Volume 
17 (January–June 2014), available from the Microsoft Download 
Center, for more information about the Microsoft takedown of 
the Jenxcus botnet. For additional technical information about 

Jenxcus, see the following entries in the MMPC blog

  MSRT February 2014 – Jenxcus (February 11, 2014) 

  Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit disrupts Jenxcus and Bladabindi malware 

families (June 30, 2014) 

  Win32/Gamarue, the third most commonly encountered threat in 1H15, was 
especially prevalent in southeast Asia and the Middle East. Gamarue is 
commonly distributed via exploit kits and social engineering. Variants have 
been observed stealing information from the local computer and 
communicating with command-and-control (C&C) servers managed by 
attackers. For more information about Gamarue, see the following entries in

encounters were heavily concentrated in Turkey, and were rare elsewhere. 
Since then, encounters have increased tenfold from 4Q14 levels, with most 
of the increase occurring outside Turkey.     

  Encounters involving two newly designated generic detections, Win32/Peals 
and Win32/Skeeyah, increased rapidly to account for a significant share of 
encounters worldwide by 2Q15. 

 

JS/Axpergle, a detection for the Angler exploit kit, is the only exploit-related 
family in the top ten in 1H15. See “Exploit families” on page 42 for more 
information about Axpergle and other exploit kits. 

  The encounter rate for Win32/Ramnit decreased from 0.52 percent in 1Q15 
to 0.40 percent in 2Q15 following its disruption in February by the European 
Cybercrime Center (EC3) with the assistance of the MMPC. For more 
information, see the entry “Microsoft Malware Protection Center assists in 
disrupting Ramnit” (February 25, 2015) on the MMPC blog at

  Families that dropped out of the list of the most commonly encountered 

malware families between 2H14 and 1H15 include the downloader families 
Win32/Tugspay and Win32/Ogimant and the exploit kit family 
Win32/Anogre.

Figure 56. Encounter rate trends for the top unwanted software families in 1H15  

  All of the five most commonly encountered unwanted software families in 

1H15 were first detected in 4Q14 or 1Q15. 

  Win32/KipodToolsCby and Win32/IeEnablerCby are browser modifiers that 
bypass user consent dialogs to install software without the user’s explicit 
permission. Microsoft security products started detecting these browser 
modifiers in January after Microsoft changed its unwanted software 
detection criteria to include attempts to bypass user consent for actions 
such as installing new browser add-ons. KipodToolsCby and IeEnablerCby 
were both encountered at high levels in 1Q15 as Microsoft security products 
detected and removed large numbers of installations from previous periods. 
Encounters subsequently decreased significantly in 2Q15, following the 
removal of these older installations. 

Figure 57. An add-on consent dialog bar from Internet Explorer 11. Add-ons that disable consent dialogs are now detected as 
unwanted software.

  A timeline of consent and control (December 11, 2014) 

  Win32/CouponRuc is an adware program that installs a 
browser extension without user consent. It can prevent 
the user from removing it or other add-ons normally, or 
changing other browser settings. 

  Win32/SaverExtension is an adware program that 

displays advertisements on webpages without identifying 
itself as the source, which is a violation of Microsoft’s 
objective criteria for classifying unwanted software.20 It 
can also install additional browser extensions that the 
user cannot remove normally.  

  Win32/InstalleRex is a software bundler that installs 
unwanted software, including CouponRuc and 
SaverExtension. It can be installed by third-party software 
bundlers. When it installs itself, it alters its own “Installed On” date in 
Programs and Features to be a year older than the actual date of 
installation, so that a user who tries to remove it by looking at recently 
installed programs might have difficulty identifying it. 

KipodToolsCby 
and IeEnablerCby 
are browser modi-
fiers that bypass 
user consent 
dialogs to install 
software without 
the user’s explicit 
permission. 

Threat families by platform 

Malware does not affect all platforms equally. Some threats are spread by 
exploits that are ineffective against one or more operating system versions. 
Some threats are more common in parts of the world where specific platforms 
are more or less popular than elsewhere. In other cases, differences between 
platforms might be caused by simple random variation. 

As Figure 58 demonstrates, the threats encountered by client and server 
platforms tend to be quite different. 

20 Microsoft has published the criteria that the company uses to classify programs as unwanted software at 
www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/objectivecriteria.aspx. For programs that have been 
classified as unwanted software, Microsoft provides a dispute resolution process to allow for reporting of 
potential false positives and to provide software vendors with the opportunity to request investigation of a 
rating with which they do not agree.

  Unwanted software was encountered significantly more often on client 

platforms than on server platforms. Five of the top ten families encountered 
by client versions of Windows in 1Q15—Win32/CouponRuc, 
Win32/KipodToolsCby, Win32/InstalleRex, Win32/AlterbookSP, and 
Win32/SaverExtension—were unwanted software families, compared to just

two (KipodToolsCby and AlterbookSP) of the top ten families 
encountered on servers. The discrepancy reflects the very 
different ways servers are used to access the Internet, enforced 
by features such as Enhanced Security Configuration in Internet 
Explorer. 

 
PHP/SimpleShell was only the 515th most prevalent 
family overall in 2Q15, but ranked 13th on server platforms. 
When installed on a compromised web server, it creates a 
webpage that an attacker can use to run shell commands on the 

server. A number of popular content management systems (CMSes) are 
written in the PHP scripting language, including WordPress, Drupal, and 
MediaWiki, and attackers often use PHP-based malware to compromise 
vulnerable servers for purposes such as sending spam and hosting exploit 
kit landing pages. 

Figure 59 and Figure 60 demonstrate how detections of the most prevalent 
malware and unwanted software families in 2Q15 ranked differently on different 
operating system/service pack combinations.

  Encounters involving JS/Axpergle, a detection for the Angler exploit kit and 
the only exploit-related family in the top ten in 1H15, were almost entirely 
confined to computers running Windows 7; although Axpergle ranked first 
on that platform, it ranked 82nd on Windows Vista and ranked outside the 
top 100 on Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. The malicious webpages that 
exploit kits use to spread malware often include scripts that detect certain 
aspects of the computer’s computing environment and only present their 
exploits to computers that meet criteria specified by the attacker. The Angler 
exploit kit clearly affects Windows 7 far more than other platforms, which 
may partially be caused by the integration of Adobe Flash Player into 
Internet Explorer in Windows 8 and 8.1. The Angler exploit kit relies heavily 
on exploiting vulnerabilities in old, out-of-date versions of Flash Player, 
which must be installed as an add-on and updated separately from Internet 
Explorer in versions of Windows prior to Windows 8. Because Flash Player is 
integrated into Internet Explorer in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, it receives 
security updates through Windows Update and Microsoft Update along with 
other operating system components, which makes it easier for users to stay 
current on security updates for the component. 

  Apart from Axpergle, the list of the most commonly encountered malware 
families was largely consistent from platform to platform. Win32/Peals, 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015   81 

 
 
Win32/Skeeyah, and Win32/Obfuscator were all among the five most

platform.

  Unlike malware, unwanted software delivery mechanisms typically make little 
effort to distinguish between different platforms, and as a result the list of 
the most commonly encountered unwanted software families is almost 
identical on each supported platform. 

Home and enterprise threats 

The usage patterns of home users and enterprise users tend to be very different. 
Enterprise users typically use computers to perform business functions while 
connected to a network, and may have limitations placed on their Internet and 
email usage. Home users are more likely to connect to the Internet directly or 
through a home router and to use their computers for entertainment purposes, 
such as playing games, watching videos, shopping, and communicating with 
friends. These different usage patterns mean that home users tend to be 
exposed to a different mix of computer threats than enterprise users. 

The infection telemetry data produced by Microsoft antimalware products and 
tools includes information about whether the infected computer belongs to an 
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain. Such domains are used 
almost exclusively in enterprise environments, and computers that do not 
belong to a domain are more likely to be used at home or in other non-
enterprise contexts. Comparing the threats encountered by domain-joined 
computers and non-domain computers can provide insights into the different 
ways attackers target enterprise and home users and which threats are more 
likely to succeed in each environment.

  Enterprise environments typically implement defense-in-depth measures, 
such as enterprise firewalls, that prevent a certain amount of malware from 
reaching users’ computers. Consequently, enterprise computers tend to

shows, the encounter rate for consumer computers was about 2.5 times as 
high as the rate for enterprise computers in 1H15. 

 

In addition to encountering less malware in general, computers in enterprise

environments tend to encounter different kinds of threats than 
consumer computers, as shown in Figure 62. Non-domain 
computers encountered disproportionate amounts of unwanted 
software compared to domain-based computers, with Adware, 
Browser Modifiers, and Software Bundlers each appearing 
between three and six times as often on non-domain 
computers. Meanwhile, domain-based computers encountered 
Password Stealers & Monitoring Tools malware nearly as often 
as their non-domain counterparts, despite encountering less 
than half as much malware as non-domain computers overall.  

  One password stealer in particular, Win32/Dyzap, was encountered by 

domain-based computers more than four times as often as non-domain 

computers (an encounter rate of 0.12 percent on domain-based 

computers, compared to 0.03 percent on non-domain computers.) 

Dyzap steals login credentials for a long list of banking websites using 

man-in-the-browser (MITB) attacks. It is usually installed on the infected 

computer by the downloader family Win32/Upatre, which is typically 

delivered via social engineering techniques that target enterprise 

audiences (for example, spam messages that mimic business faxes or 

overnight package delivery notifications). 

 Figure 63 and Figure 64 list the top 10 malware families detected on domain-
joined and non-domain computers, respectively, in 1H15.

  The four families that were unique to the top 10 list for domain-joined 
computers but not for non-domain computers are the worm family 
Win32/Conficker, the browser modifier 
Win32/AlterbookSP, the downloader family 
Win32/Upatre, and the trojan family Win32/Peals. 

  Conficker is a worm that was disrupted several years ago, 

but continues to be encountered in domain 
environments because of its use of a built-in list of 
common and weak passwords to spread between 
computers. 

  AlterbookSP is a browser add-on that formerly displayed 

behaviors of unwanted software. Recent versions of the 
add-on no longer meet Microsoft detection criteria, and 
are no longer considered unwanted software. 

  Upatre installs malware and unwanted software on the 
affected computer without the user’s consent. It is 
frequently distributed as an attachment to spam email 
messages. For more information about Upatre and how 
it spreads, see the following entries in the MMPC blog at 
blogs.technet.com/mmpc:

Security software use 

Recent releases of the MSRT collect and report details about the state of real-
time antimalware software on a computer, if the computer’s administrator has 
chosen to opt in to provide data to Microsoft. This telemetry data makes it 
possible to analyze security software usage patterns around the world and 
correlate them with infection rates. Figure 65 shows the percentage of 
computers worldwide that the MSRT found to be protected or unprotected by 
real-time security software each quarter in 2H14 and 1H15. 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015   87 

 
 
Figure 65. Percentage of computers worldwide protected by real-time security software, 3Q14–2Q15 

  A typical computer runs the MSRT three times each quarter, once for each 

monthly version of the tool that Microsoft releases. In Figure 65, “Protected” 
represents computers that had real-time security software active and up-to-
date every time the MSRT ran during a quarter; “Intermittently protected” 
represents computers that had security software active during one or more 
MSRT executions, but not all of them. “Unprotected” represents computers 
that did not have security software active during any MSRT executions that 
quarter. 

  Overall, about three-fourths of computers worldwide were found to be 

always protected at every monthly MSRT execution in each of the past four 
quarters, varying between 71.4 percent and 74.3 percent. 

  Computers that never reported running security software accounted for 
between 18.8 and 19.3 percent of computers worldwide each quarter. 
Intermittently protected computers—those that were found to be running 
real-time security software during at least one MSRT execution in a quarter, 
but not all of them—accounted for between 6.4 and 9.9 percent of 
computers each quarter. 

Computers that do not run real-time security software are at significantly greater 
risk of malware infection than computers that do. Figure 66 compares infection 
rates with protection levels worldwide for each of the last four quarters.

Figures do not include Brantall, Rotbrow, and Filcout. See “Brantall, Rotbrow, and Filcout” on page 60 for more information. 

  The MSRT reported that computers that were never found to be running 

real-time security software during 1H15 were about six times as likely to be 
infected with malware as computers that were always found to be protected.  

  Computers that were intermittently protected were about three times more 
likely to be infected with malware in 1H15 than computers that were always 
protected. 

Users who don’t 
run real-time 
security software 
aren’t always 
unprotected by 
choice. 

  Users who don’t run real-time security software aren’t 
always unprotected by choice: a number of prevalent 
malware families are capable of disabling some security 
products, potentially without the user even knowing. 
Other users might disable or uninstall security software 
intentionally because of perceived performance issues, a 
belief that protection is not necessary, or a desire to run 
programs that would be quarantined or removed by 
security software. In other cases, users lose up-to-date real-time protection 
when they don’t renew paid subscriptions for their antimalware software, 
which might come pre-installed with their computers as limited-time trial 
software. (See “The challenge of expired security software” on pages 21–28 
of Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, Volume 17 (January–June 2014), 
available from the Microsoft Download Center, for more information about

the causes and consequences of expired security software.) Whatever the 
reason, users who don’t have functioning real-time antimalware protection 
face significantly greater risk from malware infection than users who do, as 
Figure 66 illustrates. 

Security software use worldwide 

Just as infection and encounter rates differ from one country or region to 
another, so do security software usage rates, as shown in Figure 67. 

Figure 67. Average security software protection state for the locations with the most computers executing the MSRT in 1H15 

  Computers that reported being fully protected in these locations ranged 

between 67.7 percent and 79.1 percent, with all locations except China and 
Russia exceeding the worldwide rate of 74.3 percent of computers reporting 
as fully protected. 

  Computers that reported being fully unprotected in these locations ranged 
between 13.6 percent and 22.5 percent, with Russia and China reporting 
larger percentages of fully unprotected computers than the world overall. 

  Computers that were protected in some months but not in others 

accounted for between 4.6 percent and 9.8 percent in these locations. 

The rate of security software usage in a country or region often correlates with 
its infection rate. Figure 68 and Figure 69 show the percentage of computers in

Figure 69. Percent of computers reporting as Unprotected during every MSRT execution in 2Q15, by country/region 

  The locations with the most computers reporting as fully protected by real-
time security software include Finland, with 83.9 percent of computers 
reporting as fully protected in 2Q15; Denmark, at 79.5 percent; and Norway, 
at 78.9 percent. Locations with the fewest computers reporting as fully 
protected include Libya, at 46.9 percent; Iraq, at 53.3 percent; and 
Azerbaijan, at 57.9 percent. 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015   91 

 
 
 
 
  The ranking of countries and regions by unprotected rate is largely an 

inverse of their ranking according to protected rate. The locations with the 
fewest computers reporting as fully unprotected include Finland, at 10.4 
percent; Denmark, at 14.2 percent; and the Czech Republic, at 14.4 percent. 
Locations with the most computers reporting as fully unprotected include 
Libya, at 41.7 percent; Iraq, at 39.5 percent; and Azerbaijan, at 32.5 percent. 

Countries and regions with high percentages of computers reporting as fully 
unprotected also tend to have high infection rates, as Figure 70 shows.

  The infection rates for fully unprotected computers in these locations 

ranged between 3.1 and 11.4 times as high as the infection rates for fully 
unprotected computers worldwide, and between 7.6 and 33.0 times as high 
as the infection rates for all computers worldwide. In Mongolia, the location 
with the highest infection rates in Figure 70, the MSRT detected and

Protection rates can also vary by operating system, as shown in Figure 71. 

Figure 71. Average quarterly security software protection state for supported client versions of Windows in 1H15 

  Only 10.0 percent of computers running Windows 8.1 reported being 

unprotected during every MSRT execution each quarter on average, about 
half of the rate reported by computers running any other supported client 
version of Windows. At the same time, Windows 8.1 had a higher rate of 
intermittent protection than any other platform, primarily because of active 
security products expiring during the period. In most cases, this is probably 
because of commercial security products pre-installed on new computers 
with trial subscriptions that expire within a few months unless the purchaser 
pays to extend the subscription. 

  The reasons computers go unprotected can vary significantly by platform, as 

Figure 72 illustrates.

  On Windows Vista and Windows 7, unprotected computers predominantly 

report having no antimalware software installed at all. On Windows 8 and 
Windows 8.1, Windows Defender is enabled by default if no other 
antimalware software is present, so the number of computers reporting no 
antimalware software is very low. 

  On Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, expired versions of commercial 

antimalware products that are no longer receiving signature updates 
account for the largest percentage of unprotected computers. 

Advanced Threat Protection takes malware defense to the next level 

Computer security is a constant arms race: security professionals and 
antimalware vendors continually seek ways to better protect computers and 
people from harm, while attackers continually look for ways to defeat those 
protections. Conventional antimalware products offer protection against known 
threats, but are significantly less effective against unknown and unidentifiable 
malware. The advent of targeted attack groups, such as the one described in 
“STRONTIUM: A profile of a persistent and motivated adversary” beginning on 
page 3, has raised the bar for defenders, as these groups often have the 
resources to craft custom malware variants and test them against popular 
security products to ensure that they will not be detected. Although security

software vendors try to respond to new threats with detection signature updates 
as quickly as possible, new malware variants may still have several crucial hours 
or days to compromise computers, free from detection. 

Office 365 and Exchange Online seek to close that gap for their customers with 
Advanced Threat Protection, which was introduced earlier this year. For years, 
Exchange Online has offered customers multiple layers of protection from 
malicious files, including scanning incoming email attachments with multiple 
antimalware engines from different vendors to take advantage of a broad set of 
detection signatures and capabilities. Now, Advanced Threat Protection 
provides an additional layer of defense against threats and malicious links that 
have never been seen before. 

Figure 73. How Advanced Threat Protection works with Exchange Online 

Safe attachments 

Using a real-time security software product from a reputable vendor and 
keeping the detection signatures up-to-date remains one of the best ways 
individuals and organizations can protect themselves against most of the threats 
they face. Antimalware software relies predominately on detection signatures 
written to target specific malicious binaries, or groups of closely related threats 
that can be detected heuristically. This approach can be a very effective defense 
against most malware, which attackers typically try to distribute widely in order 
to compromise large numbers of computers for their purposes. Unfortunately, 
conventional antimalware software is often less effective against targeted attacks 
mounted by groups such as STRONTIUM (see page 3). These groups, which 
focus on targeting computers at specific institutions, often use specially crafted 
threats that they test against popular antimalware solutions ahead of time to

ensure that they will not be detected. By the time detection signatures are 
available to stop such a threat, it may have already compromised the 
organization. 

Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection adds a new layer of defense 
against email-borne threats that uses behavioral analysis to detect incoming 
files that may be harmful, and blocks them before they can reach their intended 
recipients. When an incoming message includes a potentially dangerous 
attached file, Exchange Online launches it in a detonation chamber—a virtual 
sandboxed environment in which potential threats can run without posing harm 
to any other resources—and monitors it for malicious behavior such as 
suspicious registry changes, attempts to access memory dumps, changes to 
executables, and other actions that malware characteristically takes. This 
monitoring makes it possible to detect and block threats that have never been 
seen before and for which no detection signatures are available. Exchange 
Online Advanced Threat Protection includes anti-sandbox detection features 
such as vulnerability detection to combat advanced threats that avoid taking 
malicious actions when they determine they are being run in a virtual machine. 

Figure 74. Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection notifies administrators when malware is detected 

Administrators can configure how Exchange Online reacts when it determines 
that an attachment contains malware. Exchange Online can be configured to 
block delivery of the message, notify administrators, and include a copy of the 
blocked message so they can analyze it themselves and determine whether 
additional action is necessary. The process of analyzing a message typically 
takes about four to five minutes; administrators can set a 30 minute time limit for 

96  MALWARE AND UNWANTED SOFTWARE 

 
 
 
analysis, after which the message will either be delivered or blocked, as 
administrators see fit. 

Figure 75. Types of malicious files blocked by Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection over a two-month 
period in 2015 

Safe links 

In addition to sending malware to recipients directly, attackers often send email 
messages that contain links to malware or drive-by download pages, in hopes 
that the recipients will click the links and become infected. To provide protection 
against malicious links, administrators can configure Exchange Online Advanced 
Threat Protection to rewrite any links in incoming messages to proxy through 
the Exchange Online service. When a user clicks on a rewritten link, Exchange 
Online checks the intended destination URL against its database of malicious 
URLs. If the URL is not determined to be malicious, the user is quickly and 
seamlessly redirected to their intended destination. If the URL is determined to 
be malicious, a blocking page is displayed instead. Exchange Online Advanced 
Threat Protection checks each URL at the time the link is clicked, which means it 
can protect users from malicious links that were not known to be malicious at 
the time the message was originally sent.

Malicious websites 

Attackers often use websites to conduct phishing attacks or 
distribute malware. Malicious websites typically appear to be 
completely legitimate, and provide no outward indicators of 
their malicious nature even to experienced computer users. In 
many cases, these sites are legitimate websites that have been 
compromised by malware, SQL injection, or other techniques 
in efforts by attackers to take advantage of the trust users have 
invested in such sites. To help protect users from malicious 
webpages, Microsoft and other browser vendors have 
developed filters that keep track of sites that host malware and 
phishing attacks and display prominent warnings when users 
try to navigate to them.  

The information in this section is compiled from a variety of sources, including 
telemetry data produced by SmartScreen Filter (in Internet Explorer versions 8 
through 11 and pre-release versions of Microsoft Edge) and the Phishing Filter 
(in Internet Explorer 7), from a database of known active phishing and malware 
hosting sites reported by users of Internet Explorer and other Microsoft products 
and services, and from malware data provided by Microsoft antimalware 
technologies. (See “Appendix B: Data sources” on page 125 for more 
information about the products and services that provided data for this report.)

Phishing sites 

Microsoft gathers information about phishing sites and impressions from 
phishing impressions that are generated by users who choose to enable the 
Phishing Filter or SmartScreen Filter.21 A phishing impression is a single instance 
of a user attempting to visit a known phishing site with SmartScreen Filter 
enabled and being warned, as illustrated in Figure 78. 

21 See “Appendix B: Data sources” on page 129 for information about the products and services used to 
provide data for this report.

Figure 79 illustrates the volume of phishing impressions tracked by SmartScreen 
Filter each month from February through July of 2015, compared to the volume 
of distinct phishing URLs visited.

  Numbers of active phishing sites and phishing impressions both increased 
between February and July, indicative of a general increase in phishing 
activity. Because phishers are frequently observed using campaigns to drive 
large amounts of traffic to a relatively small number of pages, however, the 
two metrics are generally not strongly correlated, and the dual increase 
through June and July may be largely coincidental. 

Target institutions 

Some types of sites tend to consistently draw many more impressions per site 
than others. Figure 80 shows the breakdown of phishing impressions by 
category as reported by SmartScreen Filter. 

Figure 80. Impressions reported by SmartScreen Filter for each type of phishing site, February–July 2015 

  Financial institutions have always been popular phishing targets because of 
their potential for providing direct illicit access to victims’ bank accounts. 
Sites that targeted financial institutions accounted for the largest number of 
active phishing attacks during the period, as well as the second largest 
number of impressions. (See “Win32/Banload and Banking Malware” on 
page 21 for information about regional problems with banking malware in 
Brazil.)

  Phishing sites that targeted online services received the largest share of 
impressions during the period, and accounted for the second largest 
number of active phishing URLs. 

  The other three categories each accounted for a small percentage of both 

sites and impressions. 

Global distribution of phishing sites and clients 

Phishing impression information from SmartScreen Filter includes anonymized 
information about the IP addresses of the clients making the reports, as well as 
the IP addresses of the phishing sites themselves. Performing geographic 
lookups on these addresses makes it possible to analyze patterns among both 
the computers that host phishing sites and the users that they target. 

Figure 81. Phishing sites per 1,000 Internet hosts for locations around the world in 1H15 

  SmartScreen Filter detected approximately 5.0 phishing sites per 1,000 

Internet hosts worldwide in 1H15. 

  Locations hosting higher than average concentrations of phishing sites 
include Bulgaria (98.5 per 1,000 Internet hosts in 1Q15), Libya (15.6), and 
Belize (14.5). Locations with low concentrations of phishing sites include 
Taiwan (1.2), the United Arab Emirates (1.4), and Korea (1.6). 

Malware hosting sites 

SmartScreen Filter helps provide protection against sites that are known to host 
malware, in addition to phishing sites. SmartScreen Filter uses file and URL 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015   103 

 
 
 
reputation data and Microsoft antimalware technologies to determine whether 
sites distribute unsafe content. As with phishing sites, Microsoft collects 
anonymized data regarding how many people visit each malware hosting site 
and uses the information to improve SmartScreen Filter and to better combat 
malware distribution.

  As with phishing sites and impressions, malware hosting sites and 

impressions rarely correlate strongly with one another. The number of 
impressions remained largely stable each month from February through

SmartScreen Filter increased sharply from February to April, then retreated 
to lower levels for the remainder of the period.

Locations with low concentrations of malware hosting sites included Taiwan 
(2.8), Saudi Arabia (4.3), and Finland (4.4). 

Drive-by download sites 

A drive-by download site is a website that hosts one or more exploits that target 
vulnerabilities in web browsers and browser add-ons. Users with vulnerable 
computers can be infected with malware simply by visiting such a website, even 
without attempting to download anything. 

Drive-by download pages are usually hosted on legitimate websites to which an 
attacker has posted exploit code. Attackers gain access to legitimate sites 
through intrusion or by posting malicious code to a poorly secured web form, 
like a comment field on a blog. Compromised sites can be hosted anywhere in 
the world and concern nearly any subject imaginable, making it difficult for even 
an experienced user to identify a compromised site from a list of search results. 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015   105 

 
 
 
Figure 85. One example of a drive-by download attack 

Search engines such as Bing have taken a number of measures to help protect 
users from drive-by downloads. As Bing indexes webpages, they are assessed 
for malicious elements or malicious behavior. Because the owners of 
compromised sites are usually victims themselves, the sites are not removed 
from the Bing index. Instead, clicking the link in the list of search results displays 
a prominent warning, saying that the page may contain malicious software, as 
shown in Figure 86.

Guidance: Protecting users from unsafe websites 

One of the best ways organizations can protect their users from malicious and 
compromised websites is by mandating the use of web browsers with 
appropriate protection features built in and by promoting safe browsing 
practices. For in-depth guidance, see “Top security solutions” at

Malware at Microsoft: 
Dealing with threats in the 
Microsoft environment 

Microsoft IT  

Microsoft IT provides information technology services internally for Microsoft 
employees and resources. Microsoft IT manages more than 600,000 devices for 
more than 150,000 users across more than 100 countries and regions worldwide. 
Safeguarding a computing infrastructure of this size requires implementation of 
strong security policies, technology to help keep malware off the network and 
away from mission-critical resources, and dealing with malware outbreaks swiftly 
and comprehensively when they occur. 

This section of the report compares the potential impact of malware to the levels 
of antimalware compliance from more than 500,000 workstation computers and 
devices managed by Microsoft IT between January and June 2015. This data is 
compiled from multiple sources, including System Center Endpoint Protection 
(SCEP), Windows Defender, DirectAccess, forensics, and manual submission of 
suspicious files. Comparing the nature and volume of the malware detected on 
these computers to the level of protection they receive can illustrate significant 
trends and provide insights as to the effectiveness of antimalware software and 
security best practices. 

Antimalware usage 

Real-time antimalware software is required on all user devices that connect to 
the Microsoft corporate network. System Center Endpoint Protection 2012 
(SCEP) and Windows Defender are the antimalware solutions that Microsoft IT 
deploys to its users. To be considered compliant with antimalware policies and 
standards, user computers must be running the latest version of the SCEP or 
Defender client, antimalware signatures must be no more than six days old, and 
real-time protection must be enabled.  

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015   111 

 
 
Figure 88 shows the level of antimalware noncompliance in the Microsoft user 
workstation environment for each month in 1H15. 

Figure 88. Percentage of computers at Microsoft running real-time antimalware software in 1H15 

Despite a small drop in compliance at the beginning of the year that was mostly 
related to internal testing of current and future versions of Windows, the 
average monthly compliance rate at Microsoft exceeded 98 percent during the 
first half of the year. In any network of this size, it is almost inevitable that a small 
number of computers will be in a noncompliant state at any given time. In most 
cases, these are computers that are being rebuilt or are otherwise in a state of 
change when online, rather than computers that have had their antimalware 
software intentionally disabled.  

Microsoft IT believes that a compliance rate in excess of 98 percent among 
approximately half a million computers is an acceptable level of compliance. In 
most cases, attempting to boost a large organization’s compliance rate the rest 
of the way to 100 percent will likely be a costly endeavor, and the end result—
100 percent compliance—will be unsustainable over time. 

Malware detections 

Figure 89 shows the categories of malware and unwanted software that were 
most frequently detected at Microsoft in 1H15.

Figure 89. Top categories of malware and unwanted software detected by System Center Endpoint Protection at Microsoft in 1H15 

In this section, malware detections are defined as files and processes flagged by 
SCEP, regardless of the success or failure of automated containment or 
remediation. Malware detections are a measure of attempted malware activity, 
and do not necessarily indicate that a computer has been successfully infected. 
(Note that the methodology for assessing encounters used elsewhere in this 
report counts unique computers with detections, an approach that differs from 
the methodology used in this section, in which individual detections are 
counted. For example, if a computer encountered one trojan family in February 
and another one in June, it would only be counted once for the purposes of 
figures such as Figure 49 on page 70. In the preceding Figure 89, it would be 
counted twice, once for each detection.) 

Adware was the most prevalent category, with nearly one and a half times as 
many detections as all other categories combined. The outsized number of 
internal adware detections is caused by a pilot project that MSIT has undertaken 
with the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) to improve detection of 
adware and other unwanted software. As this work is evaluated and found to 
produce valid and satisfactory results, any improved detection methods will be 
incorporated into Microsoft security products for the benefit of customers and 
end users.

Figure 90 shows the top 10 file types among threat detections at Microsoft in 
1H15. 

Figure 90. Top ten file types used by threats detected at Microsoft in 1H15 

Executable program files with the .exe extension were the most commonly 
detected type of malicious file at Microsoft by a large margin. Many of these 
detections were related to the joint effort between MSIT and the MSRC to 
improve detection of unwanted software, as noted earlier. Malicious .dll files 
were the next most common type of threats, followed by the .tmp and .temp 
extensions, typically used for temporary files.  

Transmission vectors 

Examining the processes targeted by malware can help illustrate the methods 
that attackers use to propagate it. Figure 91 lists the top five transmission vectors 
used by the malware encountered at Microsoft in 1H15.

File transfer applications 

The transmission vector most commonly used by infection attempts detected on 
Microsoft computers in 1H15 involved web browsing, followed by file transfers 
made through Windows Explorer and scheduled operating system tasks. Cloud 
backup and storage services were fourth, followed by file transfer applications, 
including peer-to-peer (P2P) applications. 

Malware infections 

Because almost all of the computers at Microsoft run real-time security software 
at all times, most infection attempts are detected and blocked before they are 
able to infect the target computer. When Defender or SCEP do disinfect a 
computer, it is usually because the software’s signature database has been 
updated to enable it to detect a threat that it did not recognize when the 
computer first encountered the threat. This lack of recognition may be because 
the threat is a new malware family, a new variant of a known family, a known 
variant that has been encrypted or otherwise repackaged to avoid detection, or 
because of some other reason. The MMPC constantly analyzes malware 
samples submitted to it, develops appropriate detection signatures, and deploys 
them to customers who use SCEP, Microsoft Security Essentials, and Windows 
Defender. 

Figure 92 shows the most commonly detected categories of malware and 
unwanted software that SCEP and Defender removed from computers at 
Microsoft between January and June of 2015.

Figure 92. Infections and removals at Microsoft in 1H15, by category 

As this chart shows, detection and infection statistics were significantly different 
in 1H15. Adware, which accounted for more than 1.2 million detections at 
Microsoft in 1H15, was not discovered on a single computer internally during the 
period. Most of the other categories also show clear differences between Figure 
89 and Figure 92, although the ordering in the latter chart is significantly 
influenced by the low volumes involved.

Figure 93. Infections and removals at Microsoft in 1H15, by file type 

Figure 93 is important because it provides information about threats that 
Defender and SCEP did not detect when they were first encountered—and 
therefore provides a clue about the areas in which malware authors have been 
focusing their efforts in recent months. More than half of the malicious files 
removed from computers at Microsoft by Defender and SCEP in 1H15 had the 
extension .exe, used by executable program files, with seven extensions 
accounting for the remaining files. The .doc extension used for Microsoft Word 
binary files was next, followed by .bin, .scr, and “._”, an extension consisting of a 
single underscore. Four other file types each accounted for a single removal. 

What IT departments can do to protect their users 

  Evaluate commercially available management tools, develop a plan, and 

implement a third-party update mechanism to disseminate non-Microsoft 
updates. 

  Ensure that all software deployed on computers in the environment is 

updated regularly. If the software provider offers an automatic update utility 
similar to Microsoft Update, ensure that it is enabled by default. See “Turn 
automatic updating on or off” at windows.microsoft.com for instructions on 
enabling automatic updates of Microsoft software.

Appendix A: Threat naming 
conventions 

Microsoft names the malware and unwanted software that it detects according 
to the Computer Antivirus Research Organization (CARO) Malware naming 
scheme.  

This scheme uses the following format:  

Figure 95. The Microsoft malware naming convention 

When Microsoft analysts research a particular threat, they will determine what 
each of the components of the name will be. 

Type 

The type describes what the threat does on a computer. Worms, trojans, and 
viruses are some of the most common types of threats Microsoft detects. 

Platform 

The platform refers to the operating system (such as Windows, Mac OS X, and 
Android) that the threat is designed to work on. Platforms can also include 
programming languages and file formats.  

Family 

A group of threats with the same name is known as a family. Sometimes 
different security software companies use different names.  

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015   123 

 
 
 
Variant letters 

Variant letters are used sequentially for each different version or member of a 
family. For example, the detection for the variant “.AF” would have been created 
after the detection for the variant “.AE.”  

Additional information 

Additional information is sometimes used to describe a specific file or 
component that is used by another threat in relation to the identified threat. In 
the preceding example, the !lnk indicates that the threat is a shortcut file used by 
the Backdoor:Win32/Caphaw.D variant, as shortcut files usually use the 
extension .lnk. 

124 APPENDIX A: THREAT NAMING CONVENTIONS 

 
 
Appendix B: Data sources 

Data included in the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report is gathered from a 
wide range of Microsoft products and services whose users have opted in to 
provide usage data. The scale and scope of this telemetry data allows the report 
to deliver the most comprehensive and detailed perspective on the threat 
landscape that is available in the software industry:  

  Bing, the search and decision engine from Microsoft, contains technology 
that performs billions of webpage scans per year to seek out malicious 
content. After such content is detected, Bing displays warnings to users 
about it to help prevent infection. 

  Exchange Online is Microsoft’s hosted email service for business. Exchange 
Online antimalware and antispam services scan billions of messages every 
year to identify and block spam and malware.   

  The Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) is a free tool that Microsoft 
designed to help identify and remove specific prevalent malware families 
from customer computers. The MSRT is primarily released as an important 
update through Windows Update, Microsoft Update, and Automatic 
Updates. A version of the tool is also available from the Microsoft Download 
Center. The MSRT was downloaded and executed more than 600 million 
times each month on average in 1H15. The MSRT is not a replacement for an 
up-to-date real-time antivirus solution.  

  The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that 
provides on-demand scanning and helps remove malware and other 
malicious software. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is not a replacement for an 
up-to-date antivirus solution, because it does not offer real-time protection 
and cannot prevent a computer from becoming infected.  

  Microsoft Security Essentials is a free, easy-to-download real-time 

protection product that provides basic, effective antivirus and antispyware 
protection for Windows Vista and Windows 7.  

  Microsoft System Center Endpoint Protection (formerly Forefront Client 
Security and Forefront Endpoint Protection) is a unified product that 
provides protection from malware and unwanted software for enterprise 
desktops, laptops, and server operating systems. It uses the Microsoft 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 19, JANUARY–JUNE 2015   125 

 
 
Malware Protection Engine and the Microsoft antivirus signature database 
to provide real-time, scheduled, and on-demand protection. 

  Office 365 is the Microsoft Office subscription service for business and home 

users. Select business plans include access to Exchange Online with 
Advanced Threat Protection. 

  SmartScreen Filter, a feature in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge, offers 

users protection against phishing sites and sites that host malware. Microsoft 
maintains a database of phishing and malware sites reported by users of 
Internet Explorer and other Microsoft products and services. When a user 
attempts to visit a site in the database with the filter enabled, the browser 
displays a warning and blocks navigation to the page. 

  Windows Defender in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 provides real-time 

scanning and removal of malware and unwanted software. 

  Windows Defender Offline is a downloadable tool that can be used to create 
a bootable CD, DVD, or USB flash drive to scan a computer for malware and 
other threats. It does not offer real-time protection and is not a substitute 
for an up-to-date antimalware solution.

Glossary 

For additional information about these and other terms, visit the MMPC glossary 
at www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Threat/Encyclopedia/Glossary.aspx. 

account credentials 
Information presented to a service provider to verify that the holder of the 
credentials is authorized to access an account. Account credentials typically take 
the form of user names paired with passwords, but other forms of identification 
are possible. 

ActiveX control 
A software component of Microsoft Windows that can be used to create and 
distribute small applications through Internet Explorer. ActiveX controls can be 
developed and used by software to perform functions that would otherwise not 
be available using typical Internet Explorer capabilities. Because ActiveX controls 
can be used to perform a wide variety of functions, including downloading and 
running programs, vulnerabilities discovered in them may be exploited by 
malware. In addition, cybercriminals may also develop their own ActiveX 
controls, which can do damage to a computer if a user visits a webpage that 
contains the malicious ActiveX control. 

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) 
A security feature in recent versions of Windows that randomizes the memory 
locations used by system files and other programs, which makes it harder for an 
attacker to exploit the system by targeting specific memory locations. 

air gap 
The complete separation of a computer or network from others, with no wired 
or wireless data connections. Data can only be exchanged across an air gap by 
physically transporting removable media from one computer to another. 

ASEP 
See autostart extensibility point. 

ASLR 
See Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). 

autostart extensibility point (ASEP) 
A place in the registry or file system that Windows checks for programs and 
processes that should be automatically launched after boot. Threats often add 

132 GLOSSARY 

 
 
themselves to one or more ASEPs to ensure that they run automatically 
whenever the computer is rebooted. 

backdoor trojan  
A type of trojan that provides attackers with remote unauthorized access to and 
control of infected computers. Bots are a subcategory of backdoor trojans. Also 
see botnet.  

boleto 
Short for boleto bancário. A popular payment method in Brazil, similar to an 
invoice. Some threats steal money by altering boletos in web pages or email 
messages. 

botnet  
A set of computers controlled by a “command-and-control” (C&C) computer to 
execute commands as directed. The C&C computer can issue commands 
directly (often through Internet Relay Chat [IRC]) or by using a decentralized 
mechanism, such as peer-to-peer (P2P) networking. Computers in a botnet are 
often called bots, nodes, or zombies.  

browser modifier 
A program that changes browser settings, such as the home page, without 
adequate consent. This also includes browser hijackers. 

buffer overflow  
An error in an application in which the data written into a buffer exceeds the 
current capacity of that buffer, thus overwriting adjacent memory. Because 
memory is overwritten, unreliable program behavior may result and, in certain 
cases, allow arbitrary code to run.  

C&C  
Short for command and control. See botnet.  

CCM 
Short for computers cleaned per mille (thousand). The number of computers 
cleaned for every 1,000 executions of the Microsoft Malicious Software Removal 
Tool (MSRT). For example, if the MSRT has 50,000 executions in a particular 
location in the first quarter of the year and removes infections from 200 
computers, the CCM for that location in the first quarter of the year is 4.0 (200 ÷ 
50,000 × 1,000). Also see encounter rate.
