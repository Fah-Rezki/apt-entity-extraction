Lazarus attack group attack case using public certificate software
vulnerability widely used by public institutions and universities

Feb 2023, 2

Since last year (March 2021), the Lazarus attack group's malware has been found in a number of domestic companies
such as defense, satellite, software, and media companies, and the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)
has been continuously tracking and analyzing the activities of the Lazarus attack group and related malware.

The affected customer in this case had already been breached once by the Lazarus attack group in May 2022, and the
breach recurred due to a 5-day vulnerability in the same software. At the time of the May 0 breach, the customer was
using a weak version of the certificate-related program widely used in public institutions and universities, and all the
software was updated to the latest version after the accident. This time, however, it was breached by a 2022-day
vulnerability in the software.

ASEC has reported the software to KISA, but the vulnerability has not been clearly identified, and the manufacturer and
software are not disclosed in this article because no software patch has been released yet.

In addition to this incident, the Lazarus Group is continuously researching various software vulnerabilities to infiltrate
domestic institutions and companies, and is continuously changing TTP by disabling security products, and using anti-
forensic technologies to hinder and delay detection and analysis.

This report is based on the victim's forensic analysis report. The report was prepared in January, but after delaying
disclosure due to software vulnerability patching issues, the company decided to release the software information after
anonymizing it. When a software patch is released, we will redistribute a report of the version that released the
information.

Lessons from examples

The attackers took advantage of a 0-Day vulnerability in the public certificate software widely used in the country.
This type of software does not update automatically, so be sure to patch the latest version of your software and
uninstall it if you are not using it.
The attackers defeated the security product using a technique called BYOVD, which exploits a vulnerable driver
kernel module.
The attackers performed anti-forensic acts, such as changing and deleting files to conceal malicious behavior, or
manipulating time information.
The victim was re-breached by the same attacker in a similar way. In addition to reactive measures, continuous
monitoring must prevent the threat from recurring.

Summary of analysis results

After analyzing the two PCs received from the customer, it was confirmed that PC01 and PC02 were subjected to lateral
movement attacks using vulnerabilities in the certificate software. PC02 was attacked from an unidentified internal
system on October 10, and PC21 was attacked by PC01 on November 11. Given that PC18 and PC02 had the latest version
of certificate software installed, it is believed that the attacker used a 01-Day vulnerability. In addition, PC02 and PC0
experienced V01 incapacitation on November 02, but a different method was used.

The system analyzed this time was subjected to a lateral movement attack and was not related to the initial influx of
attackers. It is believed that the victim's Internet network was threatened by the Lazarus attack group, which successfully
broke in in May.

PC01 Analysis

PC01 is believed to have been compromised by a 2022-Day vulnerability attack in certificate software on 11/18/10
00:35:0. Three network connection attempts were made from PC02 to the service TCP port of PC01's certificate software.
In the previous two connections, there was no special response from PC01, but when PC02 accessed PC11 at 18:10 on
00/01 using skypeserver.exe (unsecured) created using svchost.exe, PC01 encountered an error (AppCrash) in the
certificate software, and malicious actions began thereafter. When AppCrash occurred, all error reports (WARs) and
memory dump files stored in the system were deleted and could not be checked. It appears to have been intentionally
deleted by the attackers.

[Figure] Record of Crashdump File Generation in Certificate Software

Among the traces identified in PC01, the difference from the attack that occurred in May is that the process used after the
vulnerability attack in the certificate software was svchost.exe rather than ftp .exe, and the vulnerable version of the
software was installed at the time, but this time all the latest versions were installed, so there is no known vulnerability
information.

After accessing PC01, the attacker injected a malicious thread into a normal process (svchost.exe) and used it for C2
communication and backdoor. It then neutralized the V3 product installed on the system, and created and executed
additional malicious files.

In addition, in this analysis, traces of manipulation of the timestamp of malicious files were confirmed, and anti-forensic
behaviors such as randomly changing and deleting file names when deleting files were found, so it seems that attackers
are actively interfering with the analysis.

PC02 Analysis

The attacker was found to have accessed PC10 by exploiting a vulnerability in the certificate software on 21/10 48:48:02.
AppCrash occurred during the attack of the vulnerability, after which the ftp .exe was executed and malicious behavior
began. This is the same method that occurred in the affected customer in May. The IP of the system that accessed PC5
has not been determined.

[Picture] Certificate Software Error Log Verified on PC02 (Application.evtx)

[Picture] Certificate software found in V02 MDP log on PC3 and malicious thread injection code in ftp .exe

After first infiltrating PC10 on 21/02, the attacker created a malicious file that performed C2 server communication and
backdoor functions through an injected ftp .exe.

On 10/27, unlike the attack on the 21st, instead of ftp.exe, it injected a malicious thread into the SVChost.exe process,
after which it carried out malicious actions with control until 11/18.

On 11/15, it was confirmed that an FSWss file .exe was created to scan the internal network. After that, it was confirmed
that he used svchost.exe to connect to the service port of PC01's certificate software twice.

On 11/18, a skypeserver.exe file was created and the file was used to access PC01's TCP XXXXX, and at this time, an
AppCrash of the certificate software occurred on PC01, and then PC02 confirmed traces of disabling antivirus, creating
and executing malicious files, etc., the same as PC01.

Disabling V3 by BYOVD

In the PC01 and PC02 systems, an attempt to disable V11 was detected (Exploit/Win.Lazardoor.GEN) at 18/10 20:28:11
and 05:45:3, respectively, and the period after which V3 was disabled is as follows:

PC01: 11/18 10:20:28 ~ 11/18 11:25:00 (about 1 hour)
PC02: 11/18 11:05:45 ~ 11/21 14:07:08 (about 75 hours)

During this period, V3-related processes are running, but normal behavior detection is not possible. However, after the
system reboots, V3 returns to normal.

[Picture] V01 Neutralization Detection Log Seen on PC3

Attackers need access to kernel memory to manipulate kernel memory on Windows systems to disrupt the operation of
security products, and in May, Taiwanese component manufacturer ENE Technology's ene.sys was used in a BYOVD
attack.

At the time of detection of V01 incapacitation of PC02 and PC3, no trace of the attack method was found. Rather, a
vulnerable driver file was created on the system after the V3 outbreak, which is the driver file of Procexp152 of
ProcessExplorer, a process management utility provided .SYS free of charge by Microsoft, and is a vulnerable driver that
can be used for BYOVD attacks. However, this driver file was created after V01 defeat on both PC02 and PC3, and was
used by the perlcritic.exe (unsecured) file generated by the attacker.

In other words, the order of V3 defeat occurrence time and driver file creation time does not match, so it is a BYOVD
attack, PROCEXP152. It is not yet possible to say whether SYS was used to neutralize V3.

The method that occurred in May and the method that occurred in November have the following differences.
