a hosting provider targeted by TA410 and, finally, a watering hole attack by 

FishMonger against a Pakistani government website. In the same period, 

MirrorFace continued to heavily target Japanese organizations. We also 

uncovered a China-aligned APT group, which we named TheWizards, spying 

on Chinese speakers in mainland China and abroad using adversary-in-the-

middle (AitM) attacks. We also discovered that the Worok APT group has 

developed a new Go backdoor that we have named GoFighting.

Mustang Panda

In August, ESET researchers identified a campaign by Mustang Panda 

targeting a governmental organization in Slovakia. There is no indication 

leading us to think that this organization was successfully compromised. It 

is worth noting that this Mustang Panda spearphishing operation happened 

amidst the political campaigns for the Slovak parliamentary elections.

That malicious link leads to a ZIP archive containing a LNK file that 

downloads and executes an HTA script, which then deploys the group’s 

classic trident Korplug loader. The only significant difference here being 

that the malicious DLL is written in Nim. While this is the first instance we 

could find of Mustang Panda using Nim, it is consistent with the group’s 

recent exploration of new programming languages and technology.

Over the last months, we also observed Mustang Panda increasingly relying 

on Cloudflare to hide its actual C&C and distribution servers.

FishMonger

In July, ESET researchers detected a watering-hole attack on a legitimate, 

but presumably compromised, Pakistani government website. If the 

visitor is using a computer, not a smartphone, the script displays an alert 

Figure 1. Malicious alert box

The downloaded executable is a backdoor named Trochilus, which is 

commonly used by other China-aligned APT groups such as Webworm. 

However, the C&C server had typical characteristics of the ShadowPad 

servers deployed by FishMonger. Therefore, we believe with medium 

confidence that FishMonger is behind this watering-hole attack and is a 

Trochilus backdoor user.

TA410

The various TA410 subgroups were defined in a 

WeLiveSecurity blogpost.

This version of LookBack is almost identical to those 

we described in our WeLiveSecurity blogpost, while 

the Stegmap sample downloads a image containing 

the encrypted next stage encoded in the image.

GREF

We recently published a WeLiveSecurity blogpost 

documenting two active campaigns targeting Android 

users, that we attribute to the GREF group. 

FlowingFrog

In mid 2023, we observed activity by the FlowingFrog 

TA410 subgroup on the server of a US hosting provider. 

We detected samples of the Tendyron backdoor 

that were deployed after the attacker unsuccessfully 

tried to deploy multiple Jakarta Server Pages (JSP) 

web backdoors. The Tendyron backdoor and multiple 

variations of the JSP web backdoor were transferred to 

the server in quick succession.

We believe initial access was achieved by exploiting 

a known vulnerability, since the affected server 

was running an out-of-date version of the Adobe 

ColdFusion application server.

LookingFrog

ESET researchers observed activity in our telemetry 

by the LookingFrog TA410 subgroup on a computer 

belonging to a governmental entity in Kuwait. We 

detected a sample of the group’s custom LookBack 

implant, along with the Stegmap backdoor and a 

persistence tool; both of the latter two were previously 

attributed to Looking Frog in a blogpost by Symantec.

Figure 2. Signal Plus Messenger apps on Google Play (left; no longer available), Samsung Galaxy Store (center), and the FlyGram app on Galaxy Store (right)

The campaigns have distributed the Android 

BadBazaar espionage code through the Google Play 

store, Samsung Galaxy Store, and dedicated websites 

representing the malicious apps Signal Plus Messenger 

and FlyGram. The threat actors patched the open-

source Signal and Telegram apps for Android with 

malicious code that we have identified as BadBazaar, 

which has previously been used to target Uyghurs and 

other Turkic ethnic minorities. Based on our research, 

potential victims were also lured to install the malicious 

FlyGram app from a Uyghur Telegram group focused 

on Android app sharing; see Figure 2.

The purpose of these trojanized apps is to exfiltrate 

user data and, specifically in Signal Plus Messenger, to 

spy on victims’ Signal communication. After publishing 

our blogpost, Volexity published a report on three 

Android malware families – BadBazaar, BadSignal, and 

BadSolar – and attributed them to a group they call 

EvilBamboo. More specifically, the BadSignal malware 

family analyzed by Volexity is what ESET has described 

as trojanized Signal and Telegram applications, with the 

added malicious code that has the same functionality 

as earlier BadBazaar variants reported by Lookout. 

In order to avoid confusion: moving forward, we will 

adopt this naming convention to distinguish between 

the original BadBazaar, and its BadSignal variant, which 

is delivered via trojanized applications.

MirrorFace

MirrorFace continued with its campaigns targeting Japanese entities 

exclusively. In August 2023, we observed an interesting change in the 

attack vector: instead of compromising an entity via the victim opening a 

malicious attachment to a spearphishing email, MirrorFace compromised 

an IT company through a vulnerable server. Our analysis of the incident 

indicates that the server was most likely compromised through a vulnerable 

instance of Proself, an online storage service. Proself released an advisory in 

Most of the compromised systems are Microsoft Exchange servers or 

individuals based in mainland China and abroad (e.g., the Philippines, the

LODEINFO alongside various publicly available exploitation tools such as 

EfsPotato, DCOMPotato, FullPowers, Yasso, the customized reverse proxy 

frp, and a previously undescribed backdoor. This shows that MirrorFace has 

enriched its toolset repertoire and, besides its in-house developed malware, 

MirrorFace has started using publicly available exploitation tools as well.

GALLIUM

In a recent incident, we were able to determine that the attackers 

dropped a first-stage downloader through a Microsoft Exchange web 

server accessible from the internet. Interestingly, attackers accessed 

the victim’s server using a custom VPN service that is also used by 

BackdoorDiplomacy. The use of such custom anonymization networks is 

an ongoing trend among China-aligned threat actors.

these campaigns while monitoring implants known to have been used 

TheWizards

by GALLIUM in the past, including the recently documented toolset used 

during Operation Tainted Love.

TheWizards is a China-aligned APT group active since at least 2021, 

engaging in cyberespionage operations against Chinese-speaking 

Spellbinder. This tool uses IPv6 SLAAC spoofing to redirect traffic and 

deliver custom malware via software updates by legitimate applications. 

The tools developed by this group include two backdoors that we’ve named 

WizardNet and DarkNights.

Since gambling is illegal under Chinese law and Chinese citizens thus 

turn to foreign online gambling companies, this would explain why 

TheWizards group spies on such companies, most likely to identify Chinese 

citizens infringing the law. This is not the first time we have witnessed 

a China-aligned APT group targeting gambling companies: Operation 

ChattyGoblin, which we mentioned in our previous APT activity report, 

compromised a gambling company in the Philippines by targeting its 

support agents.

PerplexedGoblin

ESET researchers recently discovered a government organization in 

the European Union being targeted by an APT group we have named 

PerplexedGoblin. It uses a backdoor, TurboSlate, that we discovered and 

named in November 2022.

In our T3 2022 APT Activity Report, we mentioned the discovery of this 

new backdoor in a government organization in the European Union; it can

be deployed in various ways, including a DLL side-loading chain and a bring 

your own vulnerable software (BYOVS) chain. At that time, we attributed 

TurboSlate with medium confidence to Goblin Panda. However, after 

tracking the threat actor behind TurboSlate for months, we reevaluated our 

initial assessment: without a strong enough link between TurboSlate and a 

known group, we now track this activity cluster as PerplexedGoblin.

Worok

Worok is a China-aligned cyberespionage group, active since at least 2020, 

that targets high-profile companies and local governments mostly in Asia, 

which we first documented in a WeLiveSecurity blogpost.

ESET researchers discovered a previously undocumented Go backdoor 

that we have named GoFighting and that we attribute to Worok. 

GoFighting is a reimplementation of Worok’s PowHeartBeat backdoor 

and the GoFighting commands are the same as the ones used by Worok’s 

PowHeartBeat backdoor. A noticeable difference from PowHeartBeat is the 

presence in GoFighting of a network fallback mechanism based on GitHub.

Donot Team

Summary of India-aligned APT group activity seen by 
ESET Research in April 2023 – September 2023

During the last six months, we noticed most threat 

actors in the region moving away from malicious RTF 

(Rich Text Format) files and Equation Editor exploits, 

and trying to find new, reliable ways of distributing 

their malware. We detected attempts to use LNK 

(Windows shortcut) files, as well as CHM (Compiled 

HTML Help) and HTA (HTML Application) files, with 

varying degrees of success. The most prevalent 

compromise vector remains a spearphishing email with 

a macro-enabled Office document in the attachment.

Considering the prevalent use of the Zimbra 

collaboration suite in this region, it is no surprise to see 

that frequent phishing attempts targeting government 

organizations continue (we've documented similar 

attacks in this WeLiveSecurity blogpost) in Q2 and Q3 

of 2023; most of them use free, dynamic DNS services, 

such as servehttp.com or viewdns.net, both owned 

by No-IP. We also have detected repeated phishing 

attempts imitating the Bangladesh Army Outlook Web 

Access portal; see Figure 3.

Donot Team

In the mobile threat landscape, we saw threat actors 

increasing their efforts and a continuing evolution 

of threats. Donot Team reportedly managed to 

publish its Android trojan on the Google Play store for 

approximately two months; however, the number of 

victims is estimated to be only in the low hundreds. 

Speaking of Donot Team, in Q2 and Q3 of 2023 it 

continued its attacks on government organizations, 

mostly in Pakistan and Bangladesh. The group’s yty 

framework is still being developed, with a steady 

stream of incremental updates.

collection, possibly as an access development team for a more advanced 

group. Finally, OilRig has been observed developing and deploying C++ and 

C#/.NET backdoors that are generally full-featured backdoors. Initial access 

for OilRig still seems to be via spearphishing emails, particularly when 

targeting local governments in Israel – an effort on which OilRig has spent 

considerable time going back to 2021.

MuddyWater

OilRig

In April, we observed OilRig deploying a new toolset to several victims in 

Israel. The backdoor, OilForceGTX (named after its filename, gtx.exe), is 

deployed in C:\ProgramData\NVIDIA GTX\v10.1, a path that mimics 

legitimate NVIDIA software. OilRig also deployed two helper DLLs, 

NotifyTrayLib and Nuget_Tools, to the same directory. These DLLs are 

meant to provide runtime support in the form of additional modules for

Some interesting changes are the changing of the filename and internal 

name of the assembly from Mango to Menorah and the modification of the 

symbol names throughout the code, probably using an obfuscator/name 

generator. The C&C server was updated, but the URL structure, encryption 

key, and C&C protocol remained the same.

POLONIUM

Summary of Middle Eastern APT group activity seen by 
ESET Research in April 2023 – September 2023

POLONIUM

POLONIUM continues to field PowerShell-based backdoors, but also uses 

Python-based backdoors with a heavy focus on exploiting victims in Israel 

for espionage and data theft.

In April, we observed POLONIUM deploying a new backdoor, CreepyPie, 

to an unidentified organization in Israel. CreepyPie is a Python script that 

connects to a remote C&C server, receives and executes commands, and 

sends the output back to the C&C server. The attackers used a short 

VBScript to invoke CreepyPie, probably persisting in compromised systems 

by executing the VBScript from a scheduled task.

CreepyPie uses the WebSocket protocol to communicate with its C&C 

server. Operator command options include taking a screenshot (saved 

as GameTools.png) and any command accessible through cmd.exe  

(with output saved as a plain text file that is misleadingly named 

GameTools.dll).

POLONIUM continues to rely on the CreepySnail backdoor to target victims 

in Israel. We also saw the group utilize legitimate utilities such as  

ntdsutil.exe – a command line tool for managing Active Directory – 

to dump the Active Directory database. CreepySnail can then be used to 

extract such information from the compromised system.

a common code base used by the Lazarus group to create malware for all 

major desktop OS platforms: Windows, Linux, and macOS. Finally, Kimsuky 

continued its targeting of international scholars and journalists specializing 

in North Korea, and Konni remained active in South Korea.

We saw activity mostly belonging to the Operation DreamJob cluster in 

this period. In April 2023, we wrote about new Linux malware, OdicLoader 

and SimplexTea, in connection with the infamous 3CX supply-chain attack. 

OdicLoader is an ELF downloader responsible for fetching and executing 

the SimplexTea Linux backdoor from the OpenDrive cloud service. At the 

time, we did not know that the code used to compile the SimplexTea Linux 

In late May 2023, we observed an attack against an industrial network 

backdoor was in fact part of a common Lazarus code base used for all 

that it is a copycat of a legitimate cBridge project by CelerNetworks. This 

highlights Lazarus’s ongoing targeting of cryptocurrency-related entities.

We also continued to observe Lazarus using macOS payloads against its 

targets. Samples of SimpleTea for macOS were uploaded to VirusTotal3  

from Hong Kong and China, and we also discovered a macOS WebbyTea 

downloader. Its associated Python loader has code to pick a payload

Unix system of macOS). This illustrates again the capability and willingness 

of the Lazarus group to attack all major operating systems.

In this period, ScarCruft continued to target entities in South Korea, but 

also in Japan. It still relies on Ruby scripts in some of its campaigns, but also 

malware with very similar capabilities. Finally, we also observed a simple

and shellcode is downloaded from OneDrive. At the 

time of analysis, the server responded with shellcode

continuing usage of this backdoor by ScarCruft.

Kimsuky

Kimsuky adjusted its approaches and, like many other 

threat actors, started to utilize tools such as OneNote, 

Compiled HTML Help (CHM), and Windows shortcut 

(LNK) files in its campaigns. The group also rewrote 

some of its malware in Go to evade detections and to 

get the upper hand against security solutions.

Kimsuky’s most notable activity is its continuation of a 

spearphishing campaign targeting analysts, academic 

scholars, researchers, and journalists who focus on 

North Korean matters. In this campaign, Kimsuky 

impersonates someone from a relevant community 

and distributes high-quality spearphishing emails, 

in the person’s name, to other selected members of 

that community. This enables Kimsuky to gain the 

trust of its targets. Often, Kimsuky continues with 

the communication in a predefined way to establish

communication is reached, Kimsuky sends a malicious

to compromise the target’s machine or to harvest 

credentials through a fake website mimicking a known

to gather strategic intelligence.

Konni ran several finance-themed campaigns targeting 

South Korea. The compromise chain consisted of 

spearphishing emails with a link to a ZIP file that

During the past six months, ESET researchers continued to observe activity

of Russia-aligned APT groups mostly targeting Ukraine and EU countries. 

The functionality is like the older NikoWiper variant used in October 2022: 

These groups include Sandworm, Gamaredon, Turla, and Sednit, with 

at that time it was used against a company in the energy sector in Ukraine. 

Gamaredon being the group most active in targeting Ukraine.

In this variant of NikoWiper, the attackers left the PDB path  

Sandworm

In April 2023, CERT-UA published a notification about a cyberattack 

conducted by Sandworm against a government institution in Ukraine. 

Attackers deployed a malicious BAT script (named RoarBat), which performs 

data wiping operations using a legitimate WinRAR application. The script 

uses WinRAR.exe in command line mode to move files into an archive, and 

then deletes the original files once they have been added to the archive.

In June 2023, we discovered another variant of RoarBat, deployed in a media 

organization in Ukraine, which is slightly different: specifically, it targets 

media files with extensions such as .drawio, .jfif, .mkv, .avi, .mxf, and 

.MTS, which are commonly found at media organizations.

In July 2023, we detected two data wiping attacks conducted by Sandworm 

using a new version of NikoWiper6. This wiper was deployed against a 

government organization and private companies. It abuses a legitimate

In the current reporting period, Gamaredon significantly improved its 

intelligence collecting capabilities. Specifically, it extended the functionality 

of existing tools and developed and deployed new tools to collect even 

more data from compromised computers.

to email accounts, stored by the email clients Outlook and The Bat!.

In August 2023, we detected a new wiper that we named SharpNikoWiper. 

In June, we discovered several new tools:

SharpNikoWiper abuses the legitimate SDelete command line utility, as 

does NikoWiper, but unlike NikoWiper this variant is written in C#, hence 

the name SharpNikoWiper. In addition to data wiping using SDelete, this 

wiper attempts to rewrite with zeros the first 65,536 bytes of the first ten 

connected hard drives , if they exist, by writing directly to  

\\.\PhysicalDrive<DRIVE_NUMBER>.

During this period, we observed that Sandworm used a pro-Russian 

Telegram channel (@solntsepekZ) to promote information about 

cybersabotage operations it had conducted. This Telegram channel 

attempts groundlessly to blame CERT-UA and discredit its reputation.

•  PteroCookie, which is capable of stealing cookies from Opera, Firefox, 

Chrome, and Edge.

•  PteroSig, which is designed to exfiltrate information stored by the Signal

•  PteroGram, which exfiltrates data from the Telegram Desktop 

application.

In August we discovered two new Gamaredon tools. First, PteroBleed is 

designed to exfiltrate IndexedDB data from Opera, Chrome, and Edge 

browsers. This tool specifically looks for data stored in this database by web

versions of Telegram and WhatsApp applications, and for data that might 

be used by various Ukrainian military web services. The second tool we 

discovered that month is PteroScout, which is used for reconnaissance. It 

gathers detailed information about the compromised system.

Turla

In July 2023, CERT-UA published a technical analysis of a new implant 

named CAPIBAR that it attributes to Turla. Using ESET telemetry, we were 

able to detect the deployment of CAPIBAR not only in Ukraine but also 

in Greece and Guyana. Most victims are governmental entities, a typical 

target of Turla. 

We believe that the initial access vector used to deploy the server 

component, acting as a C&C server for other victims, is known RCE

for Windows. This vulnerability allows attackers to trigger an NTLM 

authentication request to an attacker-controlled server by sending a 

specially crafted meeting invite. Initially, this was a zero-day vulnerability 

disclosed in March 2023. A newer campaign was targeting organizations in 

Ukraine, Poland, and Czechia.

named Operation RoundPress, exploiting an XSS vulnerability in Roundcube 

Ukraine.

(CVE-2020-35730); see an example in Figure 6. Using this vulnerability, 

attackers are able to inject malicious JavaScript code into the victim’s 

Roundcube webmail server. The injected code is able to steal emails, 

address books, and create forwarding rules to steal incoming emails. This 

campaign was also documented by CERT-UA and Recorded Future.

According to our telemetry, Operation RoundPress targets government 

staff in Armenia, Tajikistan, and Ukraine.

In August 2023, we detected a Sednit spearphishing campaign targeting the 

CVE-2023-38831 WinRAR vulnerability. This vulnerability allows attackers 

to execute arbitrary code with WinRAR versions prior to v6.23. According 

to Group-IB, it has been used in the wild since April 2023 by crimeware 

threat actors against traders. Sednit’s emails used the agenda of the

spearphishing campaign, whose execution chain relies on the user manually

a BAT script from that archive. To the best of our knowledge, this was a 

completely manual execution chain, relying on the lure to motivate the user
